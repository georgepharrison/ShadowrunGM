## 1. Screen-by-Screen Analysis: Vision vs Research

### Home Page Assessment

**Vision Approach:**
- Clean hero section with branding
- Quick-action "Start New Campaign" button
- Active campaigns as cards/tiles
- Global navigation to Preferences/Catalog/Campaign Hub

**UX Research Alignment: ✅ STRONG**
- Aligns with gaming dashboard design principles emphasizing clear visual hierarchy
- Card-based campaign display matches recommended `MudCard` layout patterns
- Single-action resume functionality follows mobile-first accessibility principles
- Global navigation supports consistent interaction patterns

**Shadowrun 6e Compatibility: ✅ ADEQUATE**
- Campaign-centric approach aligns with ongoing campaign management needs
- Missing Edge/character status quick-view for resumed sessions
- No integration with AI-powered personalization for campaign recommendations

**Recommended Enhancements:**
- Add `MudChip` status indicators for campaign health (active players, last session date)
- Implement AI-powered campaign suggestions based on player preferences
- Include quick-access Edge/karma tracking for active characters

### Character Creation Screen Assessment

**Vision Approach:**
- MVP point-based system (not wizard-based)
- Single-screen approach: metatype → attributes → skills → qualities → equipment
- AI Overseer integration for build suggestions
- Live character sheet preview

**UX Research Alignment: ⚠️ MIXED**
- **Strong**: AI integration aligns with 2025 personalization trends
- **Strong**: Live preview matches real-time feedback principles
- **Concern**: Single-screen approach contradicts research recommendation for `MudStepper` workflows
- **Concern**: Lacks progressive disclosure for complex character systems

**Shadowrun 6e Compatibility: ❌ INSUFFICIENT**
- **Critical Gap**: Only addresses point-buy method, ignoring Priority system (core SR6e method)
- **Missing**: Edge system integration and display
- **Missing**: Augmentation/Essence management interface
- **Missing**: Magic/Resonance character types (mages, technomancers)
- **Missing**: Archetype guidance (Street Samurai, Face, Decker patterns)

**Required Revisions:**
1. **Implement Multi-Method Support**: Priority, Sum-to-Ten, Point Buy, Life Modules
2. **Add Wizard Workflow**: Use `MudStepper` for complex character creation process
3. **Integrate Core Systems**: Edge tracking, Essence management, magic systems
4. **Expand AI Guidance**: Archetype-specific suggestions and build validation

### Preferences Screen Assessment

**Vision Approach:**
- Rating sliders for narrative tone (violence, grit, noir vs heroic)

- Missing house rules configuration for SR6e variants

**Recommended Enhancements:**
- Add Shadowrun-specific preferences (Edge frequency, magic availability, augmentation limits)
- Implement `MudExpansionPanels` for advanced ruleset customization
- Include cyberpunk aesthetic theme selection

### Catalog Pages Assessment

**Vision Approach:**
- Central library for equipment, spells, powers, augmentations
- Filterable/searchable by category
- Detailed item pages with stats and sourcebook references
- AI recommendation integration

**UX Research Alignment: ✅ EXCELLENT**
- Aligns perfectly with character management UI patterns
- Search and filtering matches `MudAutocomplete` and `MudDataGrid` recommendations
- Grid/list view switching follows established UX patterns

**Shadowrun 6e Compatibility: ✅ EXCELLENT**
