## 1. Edge System Mechanics & UI Representation

### Core Edge System Analysis

**Edge as Central Mechanics Hub**
- Edge is expanded and more frequent than previous editions, serving as a critical tactical resource
- Characters start each session with Edge equal to their Edge rank (1-7)
- Edge accumulates during confrontation up to maximum of 7, resets after confrontations
- Three distinct categories: Gaining Edge, Spending Edge, and Burning Edge (permanent loss)

**Edge Gaining Mechanisms**
- Attack Rating vs Defense Rating comparison (4+ difference grants 1 Edge)
- Maximum 2 bonus Edge per combat round to prevent runaway accumulation
- Social situations provide contextual Edge based on participant attitudes
- Equipment, spells, qualities provide bonus Edge or cancel opponent's Edge

**Edge Spending Categories**
- **Edge Boosts** (1-2 Edge): Reroll dice, add dice, improve initiative, negate glitches
- **Edge Actions** (1-5 Edge): Complex tactical maneuvers with specific action requirements
- **Matrix Edge Actions** (1-2 Edge): Specialized hacking and Matrix manipulation abilities

**Edge Burning (Desperate Measures)**
- **Smackdown**: Automatic success with 4 net hits, permanently loses 1 Edge rank
- **Not Dead Yet**: Survive killing blow, permanently loses 1 Edge rank

### MudBlazor Components for Edge System UI
