# INTRODUCTION

Shadowrunners are not easy to define or pin down. They come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, colors, attitudes, backgrounds, skills, and what have you. Possibly the only thing that ties them together is that they’ll be damned if anyone else tells them who they are—they’re going to define themselves.

The *Sixth World Companion* exists to help *Shadowrun* players and gamemasters tap into a whole range of possibilities for characters, filling the Sixth World with the characters who are wild, bizarre, and often extremely cool. Options are here to help you make the *Shadowrun* game and the people within it what you want them to be. How? Well, let’s look at what the book contains.

The first chapter, **Runner’s World**, looks at the different ways to be a shadowrunner and includes rules for different types of campaigns. Maybe you want to run a street-level or elite-level campaign, or maybe one featuring gangers, artifact hunters, sports stars, or do-gooders. This chapter has information and rules to help with all those options.

The next chapter, **Exteriors and Interiors**, looks at the different shapes runners assume and how that affects the ways they interact with the world and how they are perceived. Choosing a metatype and a style is not just about choosing an appearance—it shapes how characters will react to and integrate with the world.

**Building a Shadow** gets into the nitty-gritty of building a character, offering several options for character creation, including Sum-to-Ten, a Point Buy system, and a Life Path system that will define a character based on their background and early choices they make in life.

Any shadowrunner needs gear to go along with their skills and attributes, and that’s where **Suit Up** comes in. It provides PACKs of gear for many different character types, making it faster and easier to assemble what you need.

The next few chapters are full of character options. **Types and Shadows** adds many different metatypes to the core five in the SR6 rulebook, and **Darker Alterations** provides rules for Infected characters such as vampires and goblins. **Express Yourself** adds in metagenic qualities, so that characters can add selected alterations that are more animalistic than mechanical. And **People of Exceptional Quality** rounds out this section by presenting many new quality options, including new quality paths for players and gamemasters who want to use qualities to help take characters on a journey.

We then move onto more rules options. **Ways to Play** introduces a whole host of rules options that allow you to adjust the rules to fit your particular play style. Each optional rule has brief text explaining what it adds to a game so you can easily find ones that might be of interest. **(Meta)Human Resources** adds new contact rules to the game, including group contacts, and **What You Get** includes lifestyle rules, focusing on where runners sleep and what the quality and different options in their doss can do for them. **A Most False Imposition** expands the rules for Heat and Reputation.

Finally, **Anatomy of a Shadowrun** presents a brief narrative of part of a run, with a column next to it explaining how tests involved in that run would be performed. It’s a nice primer for those building their understanding of *Shadowrun, Sixth World* rules.

With all these options, players and gamemasters can make characters and game options that draw them into the world, setting up runs that will deliver all the excitement and fun the Sixth World has to offer. So dive in and get running!

# Life’s Too Short  
*by Samuel Rutzick*

The whispered electronic hum of communications cut back and forth beneath the blaring ring of alarms. Soldiers—“security personnel”—in Telestrian Industries livery drew and fired their weapons, a slowly contracting noose around prey that was just as deadly as the predator. “Go! Rosethorn, Orlok, covering fire!” The words were from a scarred and pitted sasquatch. His “voice” was software that translated his hand gestures into words for the benefit of those who were not looking at him. The voice was programed to carry a natural tone of command.

Bullets shot back and forth down the slick corporate hallway of Telestrian’s communication subsidiary. Sofas that cost more than most people’s apartments all but exploded as heavy munitions cut them apart. The doors for corporate honchos’ offices, made of wood from tree species that were likely all but extinct, splintered. Security troops advanced in twos and threes, hemming in their prey.

Trapped between two groups of corporate mercenaries, four thieves—though that’s not the word they would have used—fought for their lives: the sasquatch, hauling a very large rotating minigun, a pixie, carrying a tiny sniper rifle that still was longer than his body, a ghoul that was more cybernetics than person, and a gunslinging, pistol twirling elf.

This is what a shadowrun looked like.  
This is what a shadowrun gone *very wrong* looked like.

At the sasquatch’s order, the elf and the ghoul ran. The elf went up, one foot on a shattered stool, another on a wall, a straight vertical, running up, then leaping. She jumped, twisting between bullets, it seemed, and firing her pistols. Telestrian security men went down, bullets finding the spots where plates of neoceramic armor met.

Nothing lethal, unfortunately. The corps paid their body-armor subcontractors too much. The elf didn’t even need a glance to tell that.

“Adequate shooting, Rosethorn. Overload in three, in two, in—” the gravelly voice of Orlok, the ghoul, was cut off, and a power surge flared through the office’s lights. A flash, as lightstrips blew their fuses, and then darkness. “Stormsick, you have got your cover, use it.” The sasquatch growled and turned to the pixie.

“Ashindar, rear team. I’ll make us an exit. Package still secure?”

The pixie didn’t look up, didn’t breathe. He rested the sniper rifle on an arm, seemingly ignoring the counter-fire from the slowly advancing Telestrian men. A second, and then another.

And then a Telestrian troll fell to the ground, a hole the size of a nickel in his visor.

“If you interrupt me while I’m shooting, Stormsick, then we’re all going to die here.”  
Stormsick’s electronic voice somehow sounded both neutral and exasperated. “Don’t try the cold sniper routine with me. This is still better than Sarajevo.”  
“We could be on fire, and this would still be better then Sarajevo.” Ashindar’s voice was dry, and deeper than you’d expect, for a man a half-meter tall. He checked his scope, then chambered another round. “The chip is still secure. Don’t you expect I’d keep track of, oh, the one thing we’re risking our lives for?”  
“I think you—”  
“The Abbot and Costello routine is getting old, boys,” Rosethorn shouted, ducking behind an office door. “We get it, you’re very cool.” She glanced to Orlok. “Listen, just so you know, this is not usually how this goes.”  
“Perhaps we could, then, focus less on your relationship disputes?” Orlok was cold, even for a ghoul.  
“Not what’s happening.” Stormsick slid the minigun onto his back and flexed. “Ash?”  
“Their heads are down.”  
Stormsick stood, flexing his arms in front of the security door for the elevator. He slid his fingers into the gaps between the doors and *pushed*. This is what he lived for. This is why he ran—why he spent a pile of nuyen on a communication system, why he fought and killed. There was no other moment, no other time, when the primeval strength that was a sasquatch’s birthright was so key. Despite the whir of the motors and the heavy steel, the doors slid open, the empty elevator shaft exposed—a straight shot to the lobby, and then safety.  
“Nice job, boss.” Rosethorn was first into the shaft. Never had any of the other three been so jealous of adept powers, and the elf effortlessly descended, no equipment required, leaping from side to side as she ran down the walls.  
“Showoff,” Stormsick said. “Ash, you’re next. Orlok, get your gear prepped.”  
The pixie flittered down as the ghoul stepped under Stormsick’s arms and clipped himself to the elevator cable.  
The sasquatch stepped back, and with a running jump hit the elevator shaft, hard, with just centimeters to spare as the doors slammed shut behind him. He just barely grabbed the long cable, the friction almost burning though his gloves as he skidded to a stop. With a *click*, he snapped the auto-descender from his vest to the cable, and slowly—carefully—went down.  
“Hey, Stormsick?” He heard Rosethorn’s voice before he saw her, a tremulous note in her statement. “Do we have … a backup plan? Or, anything else?”  
“Don’t worry, Rosie. I’ve got it all planned out.” He unclipped himself from the cable and stepped forward. “This shouldn’t be—”  
He took it all in a second. His friends, hands up, a dozen Telestrian men, guns in hand, no cover, nothing, and a man in a suit, already raising a revolver. He tried to move, get his cannon, do something, anything, and—  
BANG!  
Stormsick fell to the ground, a bullet between his eyes.

LIFE’S TOO SHORT // SIXTH WORLD COMPANION


---


Rosethorn thought she was going to be sick.  
The man holstered his pistol. “Well, that is enough of that.” His voice was dry, with a hint of a British accent. His lip curled, underneath a pencil mustache. “Normally, I’d do the whole dance, what you’d expect of me. You know, I’d offer you some large sum of money to turn in your employer, you’d refuse, I’d threaten to torture someone, and you’d either give in or I’d have to kill you.”  
He shrugged.  
“But frankly, I’m rather tired, and you destroyed my office, so I’m afraid that I’ll have to skip to that last step. After all, you did … how much?”  
“Director St. James?” One of the lackies stepped forward.  
“How much property damage, exactly?” St. James looked down at a proffered screen. “Ah, that’s a lot of zeroes. I’m afraid that death is in order.”  
Rosethorn was shaking. She couldn’t get to her guns. Her … her best friend was dead. This—she didn’t want to die. Not like this. Not with the safety of crowds just meters away.  
“Get ready,” Orlok muttered. “Three. Two …”  
“Ready,” St. James said. “Aim. Fi—”  
*Something* in Orlok’s arm sparked, and everything—from the digital displays of the Telestrians’ cutting-edge weapons to the scrolling stock tickers on the lobby’s walls to the projected images of soothing waterfalls and forests—went off. The guards stumbled, their own cyberware and cybergear cycling off.  
“Directed Autumndusk EMP. Very expensive. Very. You’ve got a minute until their visors and weapons reboot.” Orlok spasmed as he spoke, his own cyberware—which let him see, at the least—whirring back to life.  
“Run!”  
Ashindar and Orlok took off, but Rosethorn hesitated. Just a second. She couldn’t leave him.  
“Rosie.” Ashindar softened, almost imperceptibly. “He’d want you to live.”  
The elf moved with a start, just behind the other two. They hit the windows at a run, the panes shattering with the impact. Rosethorn could hear the yells as St. James rallied his men and told them to spread out, but the trio hit Portland traffic and were ready to vanish. They had prepared their disappearing act before. New spoofed SINs, RFID tracks throwing out false trails, dropping anything they could that’s network linked, vanishing as much as anyone could in this era of perpetual surveillance.  
They hadn’t expected to do it like this. Rosethorn couldn’t believe it. This was all wrong. This isn’t how it goes. They should have—done something. Saved him. Stormsick hadn’t just been her and Ashindar’s leader. He had been their friend. Their mentor.  
If he had to die, it should have been … heroic. Not like that.  
Not mundane.  
Ashindar swore, breaking Rosethorn from her reverie. “Telestrian tagged our ride, and our faces are all over the Matrix. Pretty decent reward, too. We need somewhere to shelter while the heat dies down. I don’t have a safehouse in Portland.”  
“I know of a location,” Orlok said, sweat on his otherwise pallid brow. “No one should find us.”  
---  
“Dive” would have been a generous description for Varney’s. The paint was decaying, the windows boarded up, and the sign blinked in and out, both in AR and reality. A bouncer—a minotaur built like a brick house—lumbered to them, sizing them up.  
Orlok stumbled to the front of the little group, and the bouncer waved him past. “You and the pixie can go in. Buffy here can wait outside.”  
“Who?” Rosethorn’s hand creeped toward her holster.  
“We don’t care for teenyboppers who want to play at being on the wrong side of the tracks, girlie.”  
“Screw you, I—”  
“Rosethorn.” The ghoul’s stare was withering but directed toward the bouncer. “Enough. You,” he nodded toward the minotaur. “Tell Kwasi I’m here, and I’m calling in that favor from the time at the place.”  
“Rosethorn? What, did you like mediocre twentieth-century bands too much?”  
“Will you just—”  
“Both of you!” Orlok grimaced. “Stop. Tell him we need protection.”  
“Who are you to—”  
“Do it.”  
The minotaur lumbered off with a foul expression, and the three runners entered the bar. It wasn’t any nicer on the inside than the outside. The lights were low, and other than a few AR slot games and a beat-up pool table, there was nothing beyond few booths and some taps.  
“Where are we, Orlok?” Ashindar said.  
“This is an establishment for my kind. Infected. The proprietor and I have … a past.”  
“And the reward …”  
“No one will turn us into Telestrian,” Orlok, said, authoritatively. “Feels safe to say that authority has never been good for us. As marginalized as we are, I feel safe to say that no one here has any fine feelings towards Telestrian, or any other security agent.”  
“We can’t stay here forever, guys,” Rosethorn said. “We need a plan, an exit strategy. And not just because I’m pretty sure that the waitress wants to put me on the menu.”  
The waitress, an older looking vampire, did look hungry. For that matter, so did everyone else.  
“Leave your prejudices behind, elf,” Orlok replied. “I apologize that this is not … up to your standards, but your options are few and far between. Take the opportunity to live in someone else’s shoes.”  
“Rosie wasn’t wrong.” Ashindar slung out his pack and pulled out the case. “We need a plan. What the hell is this thing? This … chip, or whatever it is. This is a hardened case, and Telestrian is clearly going to some length to retrieve it.”  
“Contact Mr. Johnson, maybe?” Rosethorn shrugged. “Might be able to give us an out?”  
“Clearly the meet is off the table now.” Ashindar agreed. “Though all we had was a time and place. Finding them may be harder said than done.”  
“I can solve that problem for you.” Orlok’s blind eyes looked at each of the others in turn, with a raw intensity, somehow. “I hired you. You did not find it suspicious that a mysterious fourth shadowrunner was assigned by your patron  
“You—”  
Orlok ignored the elf. “I needed a success, I needed no one asking questions, and I needed it quickly. Ano-

nymity bought me the second and the third of those requirements, while my own presence bought me the first.

“So, what is it?”

“Telestrian designed a new ocular enhancement program. It stitches together imagery from any networked cameras to provide the blind with complete and total vision. Programs like that exist, but this one maximized visual authenticity while minimizing the amount of computing necessary. For ghouls—for a nation of the blind—it’s a quantum leap forward. I was to take it back to the ghoul nation, to Asamando, for mass distribution, to save our—”

Ashindar interrupted. “And why was it shelved?”

“Greed.” Orlok shrugged, uncharacteristically. “According to my contact, at least. The cost to market it successfully, along with the R&D, would have far outstripped profits. So, they put it on an air-gapped drive and left it on a shelf.”

“Wait.” Rosethorn raised her hand, then lowered it, embarrassed. “You’re working for Asamando, yeah? The ghoul nation. Why don’t we go to them? Isn’t there an embassy nearby? Sure, not the biggest player in the world, but it’s somewhere to put a head down for a few weeks.”

“‘Working for’ is a strong phrase.”

“Elaborate,” Ashindar said, eyes narrowing.

“I …” If the taciturn ghoul could look embarrassed, this was it. “I put up the money myself. I believe the phrase in English is better to beg forgiveness then ask permission? Time was of the essence.”

“Drek.”

“No, Ash, this can still work.” Rosethorn nodded towards Orlok. “Listen, he clearly knows someone, at least. We head toward the embassy. We can be safe there.”

With a bang, the minotaur bouncer dropped a club on the table. A half-dozen vampires, ghouls, and goblins were behind him. “I’m afraid, girlie, that safe is the last thing you are.”

----

The smoke from the place that used to be Varney’s rose in the distance, as the three shadowrunners closed in on the Asamandoan embassy. This was a bad part of town, in a town that was already sharply divided. Cara’sir—like the rest of the Tír Tairngire—was somewhere where class and species drew different lives.

Elves—well, mostly elves—lived in palatial estates or fine apartments where they could walk from fine restaurant to finer shop without a single fear. Elves could work fine jobs for few hours, worry about little, and, even in this world, live lives that were, well, magical.

Everyone else? Well, the legacy of redlining and discriminatory zoning didn’t go away, even if the people at the top changed. The elves—before their own revolution, before the people at the top who hadn’t at least pretended to care about others were still in charge—had shoved everyone they didn’t want in their paradise out, and then left them to rot.

The Asamandoan embassy had been placed in an area where they could help their expatriates and their families. It was in a slum.

The Telestrian security forces ringing it did not improve the general tenor of the neighborhood.

“No.” Rosethorn ducked behind a wall, and then swore violently for several minutes. “We were so close!”

“Just a few hundred feet between here and the embassy,” Ashindar estimated. “And … twenty or so PMCs.”

“Find a second route, then?”

“We could skirt around, wait a bit. Make our move at night.”

“No.” Orlok had a note of finality in his voice. Whatever had driven him to this—whatever had made him pick up a gun, hire shadowrunners, throw himself into this crusade—he was here. In the now. And it was time to stop hiding, to stop striking from the shadows. “Here, we make our stand.”

He stepped forwards, into the plaza in front of the embassy, dialing up the voice augmentations in his cyberware. In front of the Telestrian soldiers, he turned, back to them, and looked up to the apartments. They were tenements, really, where people were packed in.

“Friends!” Orlok’s voice was like a roar. “People!” The residents gathered at their windows, attracted by the noise. “That’s what you are. People. Ghoul and man, goblin and vampire, sasquatch and pixie and centaur, everyone. You are people. With the rights, with the abilities, of everyone in this world. And yet, they treat you like—like nothing! Like garbage, to be put underfoot by your corporate masters and ignored. But we only live that way because we choose it. Rise up! Fight!”

The windows closed. Rosethorn moved to step forward, to help, but Ashindar barred her way.

“It’s a death sentence.”

“Telestrian is going to kill him, Ashindar!”

“So what?”

“So what? So what?! He’s still a person.”

“A damn fool of a person.”

“This is our chance!” Orlok’s voice was higher. Desperate. “Fight!”

The Telestrians shot him. One of their soldiers walked over, and nudged Orlok’s body with his boot.

“He’s dead, Director. Well, almost.”

The man in the suit—St. James, the man who had killed Stormsick—meandered over to Orlok, where he lay whimpering. He sat back, squatting next to the dying ghoul. “The only thing worse than a thief is a thief who thinks he has a cause. What sort of world do you think you’re in, idiot? There’s no place for you here. Blind idealism? Some sort of Robin Hood? At least accept where—or what—you are. You think you’re garbage underfoot? Then be it.”

“Fine.” Ashindar chambered his rifle. “What the hell. Hey, Rosie? Want to make like Butch and Sundance?”

“I have no idea what that is, but if you mean something like ‘doomed charge against all odds,’ then I’m all in.”

“More sheep for slaughter?” St. James was contemptuous. “Here to avenge your fallen comrades?”

“Something like that,” Rosethorn said.

“Then what? Go ahead and save the world?”

Ashindar smirked. “Nothing so complicated.

“After, what, you finish killing all of my men, and every other Telestrian employee in the city?”

“Life’s too short to worry about those things, that’s what Stormsick always said.” Rosethorn spun her pistol on her finger. “Of course, you wouldn’t know that, seeing that you killed him!”

“Yes,” St. James said. “That I did. The best part of my job, really.”

“Hey, corpo?” Ashindar spat. “Die.”

They raised their weapons, and ran.

# RUNNER'S WORLD

**POSTED BY: LIZZIE**

When you think of a shadowrunner, who do you picture? Is it a cybered street samurai with mirror-shade eyes and chrome limbs? A beautiful elf clad in robes engraved with symbols of power, one hand glowing, ready to cast a manabolt? A hotshot decker slicing through the Matrix with a quicksilver persona and laser beam eyes? Sure, that’s how they look on the trid, and there are some of us who live up to, or perhaps define, those stereotypes. But the Sixth World is a huge, weird place, and the people who run the shadows are as many and varied as metahumanity itself—perhaps even more so.

The first thing you need to know about shadowrunners is that we’re people. Sounds a bit simple when I put it like that, doesn’t it? It’s a little facile, but it’s also true. It’s so easy to think of us as stereotypes or caricatures, or to define us by what we do for a living. Criminals, murderers, kidnappers, spies, freedom fighters, terrorists, and thieves are all descriptions of what we do, but they don’t define who we are. Everyone has their own reasons for going into the biz, and those reasons are as different from one runner to another as any person’s life choices. One commonality, though, is that almost no one goes into the biz as a first resort.

So at this point you’re probably wondering what the frag I am trying to tell you about shadowrunners. I guess the best I can manage is to advise you to stop thinking of us as a type of person, or even a single career. There’s no shadowrunner university, partly because what we do is usually illegal and everyone wants to pretend that it’s not really happening. But also because we come from almost any background you can imagine, and we have vastly different ways of doing things. No shadowrunning team is made up of people who just call themselves “shadowrunners.” You need a wide range of skills, talents, and equipment to pull off all but the milkiest milk runs, and no one person is ever going to be able to cover all of those bases. Ever play an MMORPG on the Matrix? Your party better

have damage dealers, healers, and a mix of support classes. Similarly, a full runner team is going to have someone who’s good at combat, someone else who’s good at talking to people, a hacker of some kind, a mage, and a rigger pulling double duty with surveillance drones and a getaway car. A good team takes on whatever weird-ass, nearly suicidal objectives Mr. Johnson decided to throw a credstick at this week and gets it done with a mix of techniques and talents.

A good team. I think maybe that’s at the core of it. When it comes down to it, lone wolves just aren’t a thing in this biz, and the few ones there are burn out fast. The defining element of shadowrunners is teamwork. You need a good team that you can rely on not just to get the job done, but to make sure everyone goes home with a fat credstick afterwards.

So what makes up a good team? Well, for starters, trust and respect. You’re all going to be relying on each other in life-and-death situations, and there’s no shortage of temptations to sell out your team for some easy nuyen. It might seem easy to screw over your team, chummer, but it’s not easy living very long afterward. Trust me. I’ve heard plenty of stories about runners who thought they were smart enough to put one over on their team and keep all the loot for themselves. Not one of those bastards got a happy ending, and every one of them thought they were smart enough to cover their tracks. The ones who thought they got away with it ended up getting geeked by the next team they tried to take a job with. No amount of nuyen is worth burning your team, so don’t do it, okay?

It’s important to treat each other with respect, and from that basis of respect you can build up trust. After nearly two decades in this biz (off and on), I can tell you that what I value most isn’t nuyen or orichalcum. It’s chummers I can probably usually trust. So if you want to be a good shadowrunner, make sure you’re someone your chummers can trust—not just because you won’t screw them over, but also because you’re going to hold up your end.

After that, we can get into specifics. I like to call these the pillars of a shadowrun team, and the ideal team has every one of them covered. They are combat, social, tech, transport, and magic.

The street samurai comes to mind as an iconic example of the combat role. Almost nobody follows that bushido bulldrek—unless you’re a Renraku stooge—but the name sticks anyway. A street samurai is usually a mundane metahuman made into a super soldier by cybernetic and biotech augmentations. They’re wicked fast, lethal as frag, and usually just as dangerous up close as they are at long range. The one drawback to them is that they tend to use violence as a first resort. Sometimes that’s what you need to get the job done, but it’s usually best to save such methods for when they’re really necessary. High body counts and loud firefights lead to all manner of complications, not the least of which are incoming high-threat response teams. The worst of the street samurai, the fraggers I hope you never have the misfortune to run with (but let’s face it, they’re as common as NERPS), are the ones who are always looking for an opportunity to throw down. A little bravado is fine, but mindless combat monsters really only work out well as gangers or cops. On the flipside, a street samurai who knows when not to sling lead but sticks to the plan and tries to keep the heat low is someone worth keeping on your team.

Adepts can also take care of a team’s combat needs. Adepts use magical abilities instead of expensive chrome to surpass the limitations of their metahuman bodies. In the old days we used to call these people physical adepts, or “physads” for short, and they were almost exclusively close-combat specialists. Times have changed, and now plenty of adepts use guns and other weapons. Their lack of reliance on detectable augmentations often makes them appear much less dangerous than their chromed counterparts, which means that they make damned good ninja types. That said, there are plenty of adepts out there who focus on non-combat skills, so you can’t just assume that a runner is a killer stealth assassin just because they say they’re an adept.

The runners who fill the combat role on their team are usually dangerous, powerful, scary badasses. So much so that it can be easy to think of them as invincible and unstoppable, but you’ve always got to keep in mind that your target is usually a megacorp with more resources than you. They’ve got more people, drones, and vehicles with guns than you do. No matter how deadly your combat people are, your opposition will eventually overwhelm and destroy you in a drawn-out, stand-up fight. On a shadowrun, combat is just one tool. It works best in short bursts rather than sustained battles. Use it wisely when you need to, but *only* when you need to. And don’t ever forget that every fight has the chance to be your last. Choose your battles, and make sure you only choose the ones you can win. It’s okay to run when you need to. The runners who equate retreating to cowardice rarely live though more than a couple runs.

The social pillar is usually held up by the person we call the “face.” The face’s jobs are to mingle, negotiate, trick, intimidate, and sometimes interrogate. The context in which the face almost always shines is during the meet with your Mr. Johnson. It’s their job to get your team as large a payment as possible, but also to convince your employer to give you all the information they can. Johnsons love to hold things back. Some do it out of a sense of discretion, and some do it as part of a test to make sure they’re working with professionals, but most of them just do it out of habit. Ask questions, dig deep, and find out what you’re really getting into. Then make the fragger pay through the nose

// RUNNER'S WORLD


---


to get your team to do it. Once that part of the job is done, the face usually has plenty of contacts to call in order to get the rest of the intel you’ll need to get the job done. Some runs hinge on pulling off a confidence game, and the face will take point on those. For most runs, the face is a support role. Their quick wits and smooth words are often the best way to avoid arousing suspicion while you’re poking around somewhere you definitely aren’t supposed to be. And when the drek hits the fan, sometimes a good lie will get your team out of danger better than a grenade launcher ever could. But bring the grenades anyway, just in case.

For tech, we have the hackers and B&E specialists. Hackers come in two forms: deckers, who use technology to interface with and manipulate the Matrix, and technomancers, who accomplish similar feats without using technology. I like to think of technomancers as a new form of magic, but I’ve been told by someone who seemed pretty sure of themselves that I’m wrong. No matter how they get it done, their job is to make tech do what your team needs it to do, instead of what the people who own it would prefer it does. They open locks, fool cameras, disable alarms, operate elevators, control automated turrets, and can even hack the cyberware and weapons the opposition might otherwise use against you. Sometimes the main objective of a shadowrun is to steal a file from a secure storage system (usually unplugged from the Matrix so you have to physically get to it first). For those jobs, the hacker takes point. Their information-gathering talents are incredibly useful in support of other objectives as well: finding maps, guard patrol patterns, personnel logs, itineraries, and of course paydata. A shadowrunning team without a hacker is almost always going to be running in the dark, which is something to be avoided. But there are ways around locks, alarms, and sensors without messing with the Matrix. That’s where the B&E (short for breaking and entering) people come in. These people carry security-defeating gadgets and make do with a toolkit and stealth to find a way through, around, or under whatever might stand in their way. When a good B&E specialist and a hacker are working together, they’re unstoppable.

The rigger shines in the transport role, but not every driver or pilot has headware. Some prefer to use manual controls, and an adept who focuses their magic on being able to drive better is a sight to see. But most of the top drivers are riggers, and a rigger is almost always better for the job than a non-rigger. That’s because riggers use a control rig that provides them with sensations from their vehicles that make the machines feel like part of their body. Many shadowrunners have their own rides, but if you need to get away from those determined security forces who are hot on your tail, the transport specialist is the best bet to get you home safe. But what do they do in between going to and leaving from a shadowrun? Well, chummer, that’s where drones come in. From small to large, drones provide recon, overwatch, and even combat support. The most vicious combat drone doesn’t come close to the power of an adept or street sam, so they make a better hammer than an anvil. But it’s nice to have an army to back you up.

And finally we come to my specialty: magic. The magic role has two main purposes, one very specific and the other incredibly broad. The first purpose is to overcome, defeat, circumvent, or counter the mages who work for the other side. Many are capable of projecting their spirit into the astral plane to locate magical defenses, patrolling spirits, and Awakened guards. If you don’t have a mage on your team, you won’t be able to deal with magical threats very effectively. Though, if I’m being honest, bullets are pretty effective against most mages. Sometimes you can make it work, but it’s so much better if you have some mojo on your side. The other purpose of a mage is, well, everything else. Mages can sling fireballs and other forms of death, but they can do so much more. Being able to go invisible, levitate, create illusions, control guards, or enhance the capabilities of your fellow runners opens up so many possibilities. And summoning a powerful spirit has made the difference between a failed run and a payday more times than I can count. Just keep in mind that your mage is going to be a primary target. Try to keep them from getting geeked—because along with everything else, their healing spells might be your team’s best medical resource.

If you’ve got the combat, social, tech, transport, and magic roles all covered by the people on your team, you can probably handle just about any kind of run that comes your way.

And that brings us to the topic of the shadowrun. What is a shadowrun? Doing crime for money is a popular and succinct explanation, but not every run involves breaking the law (though most of them do). What makes a shadowrun a shadowrun is the implicit promise of discretion and deniability. Your job as a shadowrunner is to pull off a mission of some kind, but without officially, and definitely not publicly, representing your employer. Because even if what they hired you to do might not be illegal, it’s definitely not something they want the public knowing they hired someone for. And that’s the key right there. Corp language calls it “plausible deniability.” It means that you don’t usually have any overt assistance from the party you’re working for, and if you frag up, nobody is going to have your back.

But what about the nature of the work? What can you expect to be hired to do? I could say that every run is different, and that would be completely true, but that’s unhelpful. Runs tend to fall into a few broad categories, or sometimes a combination: retrieval of stolen or missing as-


---


sets, extracting personnel (that’s corp speak for kidnapping), conducting an unofficial investigation, sabotaging a corporate project or asset, smuggling, framing someone for a crime, creating a distraction, and wetwork. That covers most of the range of work you can expect to be hired for, but it isn’t an exhaustive list by any means. The common thread among all of these activities is that your employer absolutely does not want to be connected to it in any official or public way.

So forget about job security, benefits, and recognition for a job well done. If you do the run, get paid, and manage to keep processing oxygen into carbon dioxide, be content with that.

Now, about the people who hire shadowrunners. First off, we know that every Mr. Johnson needs something done on the down-low, something important enough to risk the danger and expense of hiring deniable assets. Usually this person is acting on behalf of a megacorporation, but it’s not uncommon for internal competition to involve shadowrunners. And while the corps would like the general public to believe that shadowrunners are a tridshow fantasy, most make room in their corporate budgets for hiring them. They like to pretend that our capitalist dystopia runs smoothly, and that following the rules they impose is the key to a happy and prosperous life. But they, you, and I all know that’s bulldrek. The world is a messy place, full of more people than you can imagine, and our wants and needs naturally come into conflict. Those with the power and wealth to get things done outside the bounds of law or civility will always take advantage of it to get what they want. And that’s the kind of person who’s going to be sitting on the other side of the negotiating table, hiring you to do their dirty work. So don’t feel like you owe them a fragging thing. Take their money—as much of it as you can get them to part with—but don’t ever for a moment forget that you’re just a means to an end.

There’s something else important to be said about Johnsons, and that’s the idea that every other one is going to have you killed instead of paying you. If you use the plots of trid shows as a guide, you might think double-crosses are common. While this does happen to some people, it’s actually very rare for a professional Mr. Johnson to betray the runners they hired. Most of them just want the job done and are relieved when it goes well. Sure, it’s always possible you’ll get pulled into deep waters, and someone will decide that every loose end needs to be cut short. But shadowruns are business as usual in our world, and any Mr. Johnson who gets a reputation for burning runners is going to have a hard time doing business. And taking out a team of shadowrunners is never a sure thing. It almost always gets messy and causes more problems than anyone expects it to solve. Statistically speaking, you can be reasonably certain that any professional corporate employer is aware of these issues, and they can be expected to pay up and be happy for a job well done—if you do things well. All bets are off if you make a mess of it, though. The ones you really need to watch out for are the amateurs. An amateur Mr. Johnson probably never expected to hire shadowrunners until something made them desperate. They’re usually working on their own, either using their own resources, stolen resources, or straight-up lying about what they’re going to pay you. They’ve made some big mistakes, and they’re pinning all of their hopes on you to get them out of trouble. Such Johnsons are never to be trusted. If you sense the money is too good to be true, prepare yourself to deal with more trouble than your employer describes. One good thing about them is that they’re usually sloppy, and experienced runners will take advantage of that to get some leverage over them.

And that brings me to the topic of legwork. Legwork is a catch-all term for all the work you do to find out about the shadowrun you agreed to pull off. If you’re hired to steal a prototype from a corporate research facility, you don’t just pull up to the place and try to break in. You need to find out as much information as you can about your target, like a map of the building so you know where to go once you break in, how many guards are on duty, where the cameras are, what kind of alarms are in place, and so on. Then you can use this information to plan your run. Legwork, plan, run. Always in that order.

This is part of the job that every role has a part to play in: hackers search for data on the Matrix, including locating where the cameras and alarms are; faces talk to people, getting them to reveal more than they know they should; your combat people and riggers with surveillance drones get into position for physical observation; while mages identify any magical defenses. And everyone has contacts—people they can call for information, gear, and other assistance, at a price.

While doing your legwork, it’s easy to forget about everything except the target of your run. Don’t make that mistake, if you can help it. Every shadowrun happens because there’s some drek going on, and the more you can understand that drek, the lower the likelihood that it’s going to be tossed at a fan blowing your direction. Or maybe you’ll at least know enough to bring a raincoat.

Enough with the drek metaphors, though. The more you know about what’s going on, the more likely you are to succeed at your objectives without having a nasty surprise come down on you. Find out everything you can about the person who hired you, who they work for, what’s recently been going on with that company, who are their chief competitors, who else might be going after your target, and every other detail you can discover within a reasonable timeframe. You should be putting about half of your efforts into legwork relat-

# Game Information: Ways to Play Shadowrun

## Alternate Power Levels

Character creation in *Shadowrun* assumes that you are building a competent and well-equipped shadowrunner. You may wish to adjust character creation rules if your campaign calls for characters with less experience and resources, or more elite characters with extensive resources.

### Street-Level

This level covers characters like gangers, wage slaves, and rent-a-cops. These people are starting from the bottom, or perhaps recently experienced characters who had a fall. Alternatively, this might instead represent younger characters with less experience and fewer resources.

If you use the priority system, you create street-level characters by selecting one priority at B, two priorities at C, one at D, and one at E.

If you are using sum-to-ten (see p. 27), you in-

>
> The last thing I need to make sure to get across is the importance of recognizing that you’re part of a big world that doesn’t recognize that you have value, or even rights. That’s what being SINless means. Wherever you go, your very existence is illegal. For many of us, this is why we run the shadows. Either we weren’t assigned a SIN, our identities were stolen or erased, or we left behind the ruins of an old life by having our SIN burned away. For the SINless, there are no legitimate career opportunities. So we turn to running the shadows. If you want to survive, you have to keep things in the shadows. Don’t draw extra attention, don’t leave behind evidence if you can help it, and try to do things quietly. If you have to go loud, make it quick, and use a distraction of some kind to delay the inevitable response. Try your best to keep your heat low, which sometimes means you’ll go a month or more without working. It’s a dangerous life, and few survive to any form of comfortable retirement. But there’s always something interesting going on, mysteries to uncover, excitement to be had, and plenty of nuyen to be made. Just watch your back, shoot straight, conserve your ammo, and don’t ever cut a deal with a dragon. Actually, there’s no point worrying about that last one about the dragon. If that comes up, you won’t have any choice in the matter. Just do your best to survive, and be very, very, polite.

stead should call it sum-to-eight, because the point values of your selected priorities must add up to 8. Additionally, you may not choose priority A.  
For point-buy (p. 28), use 80 character points instead of 100.  
If using the life path system (p. 30), choose six adult life modules instead of eight.  
Illegal items (marked with the letter I next to their availability number) are not available to street-level characters. An exception to this is cyberdecks, which are always illegal except when provided by an official authority. Street-level deckers should have someone who can sell one to them, because they’ll need it.

### ELITE  
This category covers elite runners—high-level corporate operatives, high-level celebrities, and powerful executives. These people have experience, power and wealth, along with the opportunities to put them to use.  
If you are using the priority system, you may choose one priority at A, two at B, one at C, and one D.  
Sum-to-ten (p. 27) becomes sum-to-twelve, which means that you may buy 12 points worth of priorities.  
For point-buy (p. 28), use 120 character points instead of 100.  
If you are using the life path system (p. 30), choose ten adult life modules instead of eight.  
There are no availability restrictions on any gear for elite characters.

### ALTERNATIVE CAMPAIGNS  
The default *Shadowrun* style is a game that follows the career of a team of shadowrunners. The Sixth World is a complex and rich world, which provides many opportunities to tell a wide range of stories. Included here are some suggestions for alternate campaign styles, along with some guidelines for how you might approach them.

#### SLICE-OF-LIFE  
Many alternate campaign concepts don’t fit the usual *Shadowrun* gameplay path of getting hired for a run, doing the run, downtime, repeat. Campaigns that focus on the day-to-day lives of the characters call for different pacing, as well as different guidelines for karma and nuyen rewards. It can be very satisfying to explore how your characters live from one day to the next within the Sixth World. When you’ve decided to play a campaign that uses slice-of-life settings, first determine what the focus of the campaign will be. You might be playing regular people who live in a particular building or neighborhood, or the campaign might focus on a place of business where the player characters work, or a shared occupation. Once this is established, the average lifestyle is set. For most campaigns, Low lifestyle is appropriate, but Medium or even High lifestyle might be a good fit for corporate-based concepts. This represents the general status of the player characters and their peers.  
Karma awards are given out at the end of each session, rather than with the conclusion of a shadowrun. Every session should have a static Karma award, which is 1 for Low lifestyle campaigns, 2 for Middle, 3 for High, and 4 for Luxury. Bonus Karma is awarded for achieving goals, arriving at milestones, or even noteworthy unpleasant experiences and setbacks. This Karma award can range from 1 to as much as 6, depending on how important, difficult, or involved the source of the reward was.  
As far as nuyen rewards go, we can assume the characters earn just enough nuyen to maintain a lifestyle that matches the campaign. The manner in which they might acquire more funds will vary greatly depending on the specifics of the campaign. Gamemasters could consider allowing them to exchange 1 awarded Karma for 2,000 nuyen, as per the Spend Customization Karma rules (p. 66, SR6). No more than 2 Karma per session should be exchanged this way.

### LAW ENFORCEMENT  
One alternative to shadowrunning is to have a campaign that focuses on law enforcement, which can include unofficial as well as official approaches to the job. One way to conduct this sort of campaign is to have the player characters make up a special task force that is given individual cases to deal with. Sessions will be spent investigating, dealing with people who don’t want a particular crime solved, and eventually apprehending the guilty party. Award Karma at the end of each case (or for longer-term cases, per session) as you would for a *Shadowrun* of equivalent difficulty. Heat may accrue as normal, as it is a measure of how much the players can get away with off the books. Consequences for accruing Heat will involve being called in to get chewed out by your boss, and could escalate to arrest in the case of extreme violations.  
Remember that in the Sixth World, law enforcement is almost always compromised in some way. Corporate interests always shape their work, usually because they are part of a corporation themselves. They have pressures to consider profitability and keeping the best-paying customers happy in ways that can severely interfere with their work. Those tensions can add interesting elements to a campaign while maintaining a cyberpunk feel.  
One way to deal with these tensions is to do law enforcement outside of normal channels. Rather than being police detectives, the PCs might be a team of private eyes, or gangers looking to defend their neighborhood (like the Skraacha of Seattle’s Underground). They could be people who know the corporate police won’t really look out for people on the bottom rungs of society’s ladder, so they


---


do what they can to help right some of the wrongs that need correcting.

If PCs play characters employed by a government or law-enforcement corporation, they cannot take the SINner quality (or any related quality), because they are expected to have a legitimate SIN as part of their basic qualification for the job and don’t get bonus Karma for having one.

## GANGERS

In this mode, instead of running the shadows, the player characters are members of a street gang. Whether they’re in charge of the gang or just joined and need to work their way up, this works especially well for street-level campaigns that focus on the day-to-day lives of the gang.

Turf is a key feature of a gang campaign. It likely represents part of a neighborhood, but also includes other aspects of the gang’s influence, such as black-market connections, their network of contacts and alliances, as well as places on the Matrix. No matter what kind of gang you are, one of your highest priorities is to maintain hold on your own turf, and maybe gain some more. The PCs’ gang has a Turf attribute that begins at 1, which is a measure for everything that makes up the gang’s resources and influence. Instead of going on shadowruns, day-to-day ganger life is filled with events, needs, and opportunities. A straightforward example of an event that might affect a gang is an attack by a rival gang, some ghouls, or even a swarm of devil rats. More complex events might be signs of a rising threat that must be identified and located before it can be dealt with, or having to go cause a distraction so that some fellow gangers can get away from the cops. Needs for a gang might include acquiring material resources, recruiting new members, or improving relations with another faction. These are things that need to be done, and if the PCs don’t do them, they won’t happen. They’re kind of like events because they’re imposed on the PCs, but they aren’t as sudden or urgent as events tend to be. Opportunities include anything that the PCs might be able to do in order to improve their gang’s situation in some important way, but only if they take action and risk life and limb to get it. This might be almost anything that a shadowrun could be, but they are more self-directed. There’s no Mr. Johnson to tell gangers where to go and what to get, so they need to find their own targets. Theft, sabotage, performing a job for a someone else (such as a megacorp, organized crime outfit, or another gang), hijacking merchandise, providing a safehouse for someone on the run—the possibilities are as varied as any Shadowrun campaign.

At the end of a session in which the players’ gang succeeded in an event, need, or opportunity, roll a die. If the result is greater than the gang’s current Turf rating, that rating goes up by 1. If the gang failed an opportunity, Turf is not affected, but in the case of a failed event or need, roll a die. If the result is lower than the gang’s current Turf attribute, reduce Turf by 1. The more a gang has, the more it takes to move up, and the easier it is to lose it.

At the beginning of every session, the PCs’ gang gets a bonus pool of Edge equal to the rating of the gang’s Turf. This Edge may be spent on behalf of any gang member, including PCs and NPCs. It is a single pool of Edge that is shared by the gang; any player may choose to use it at any time. It only refreshes at the beginning of each session.

For Karma rewards, use the Slice-of-Life guidelines, with bonus Karma awarded based on the challenges involved with individual events, needs, and opportunities the PCs get involved in. The gang is assumed to provide the PCs with a Low lifestyle, but any money they make is based on the jobs they do (and what they can steal). When the PCs successfully complete an event, fulfill a need, or follow through with an opportunity, they make some extra nuyen. By default, this should be 2,000 nuyen each, with an additional 500 nuyen bonus for each significant reason that the gamemaster deems appropriate. For example, if an event involved an attack against the PCs’ gang, they would make 2,000 nuyen each if they just fought to survive. But if one of them took decisive action or put themselves at greater risk, they would earn a bonus. If the PCs were sent to knock off a Stuffer Shack for snacks, they get paid 2,000 nuyen each if they get the job done. If they managed to work out a way to steal a few commlinks while they were there, they would earn a bonus.

Generally speaking, the amount of events, needs, and opportunities should be relatively equal, but try to avoid always going through them in the same order, and never do the same thing more than twice in a row. For example, it’s okay to have two events in a row, but afterwards you should probably have at least one need or opportunity before another event occurs. Ultimately, this pacing is up to the gamemaster, but should be based on the progression of the story that emerges through playing the campaign.

In between these events, take some time to play through some day-to-day scenes. These are a great opportunity to give players the chance to explore and express who their characters are, their relationships to each other, their gang, and neighborhood, and interact with NPCs on their turf (and even in their own gang). Entire sessions might be played based on helping a fellow ganger get over a break-up, doing repairs on the safehouse, or going out to the clubs.

## ARTIFACT HUNTERS

Artifact hunters are teams of individuals with archaeological, anthropological, and arcane exper-


---


tise who work for an organization (or a dragon) to locate and recover artifacts of magical significance. They travel all over the world to potentially dangerous sites, rarely with permission from local authorities, usually in a race to beat other artifact hunters to the find. Sudden magical anomalies, mana storms, or even just rumors can spark an artifact race.

To start this kind of campaign, choose an organization or dragon that the player characters will be working for, and another organization or dragon that represents their most competitive rival. Awakened individuals make up the majority of such teams, and so at least half of the player characters should be Awakened. Some example organizations are the Draco Foundation and the Atlantean Foundation. Arleesh is one dragon that is highly likely to be involved in these matters, though any dragon might take an interest.

Individual adventures are much like shadowruns, though you know who you’re working for (usually), and you make a steady paycheck between missions. Most involve traveling to a new location where something unusual of a magical nature is occurring and investigating the anomaly for knowledge and material. Encountering other artifact hunter teams is a common obstacle and might result in rivalries, temporary alliances, or even outright combat. Other missions might involve infiltrating a secure location in order to reappropriate artifacts that have the unfortunate status of not belonging to your organization or patron.

Karma awards may be determined the same way as with a normal Shadowrun campaign. Pay is assumed to be enough to cover lifestyle, with additional amounts paid out per mission. These amounts should be relatively equivalent to what a similarly difficult shadowrun would pay.

## Sixth World Sports

The Sixth World has seen the rise of some unusual and exciting sports, in particular urban brawl and combat biker. Both of these sports were adapted from formalized gang warfare but have become as popular as football and auto racing. In this alternate campaign, the player characters are athletes on a combat biker or urban brawl team. Establish whether the campaign will take place at the level of amateur leagues, college sports, professional leagues, or an illegal underground league.

Use the standard character creation rules, though many sports may have restrictions on augmentations or Awakened status. You may not create a character that is ineligible to play the sport, unless you are playing an off-the-court support role, such as a coach, trainer, pit crew, etc.

Because the player characters are all assumed to be legitimate SINners, the SINner quality (and any related qualities) is not available. Heat rules are only used if the characters engage in illegal activities, which is likely to result in a career-ending disaster.

Sessions of this campaign will often include one or more sports events in which the PCs compete against other teams. Now, playing through each game one combat round at a time would make resolving a single sports event take all the time you have for an entire campaign. Instead of focusing on every combat round, break each game up into four quarters, with a teamwork test followed by a detailed scene.

The teamwork test involves every player character. First, the gamemaster describes the situation the team is in, including the current score, along with other relevant details like the mood of the crowd or what the other team is doing. Then the players must make a skill test using Athletics (Sports) + Agility, or an alternate skill and attribute combination that the gamemaster agrees is appropriate. For instance, urban brawl involves combat and stealth, so Firearms, Close Combat, Stealth, or even Perception might be appropriate alternatives. For combat biker, Piloting as well as Outdoors (Navigation) could be equally useful. A clever player might use Influence or Con to mislead or intimidate opponents. The possibilities are only limited by your creativity and the narrative context. The player who rolls the most hits is the MVP of the play and counts as the leader for the teamwork test. They may immediately roll as many additional dice as the total number of hits rolled by their fellow players, even if that number exceeds how many ranks they have in the skill used. The gamemaster chooses a dice pool from among the opposing NPCs and adds twice their Professional Rating as a dice pool bonus.

For the first quarter of the game, neither team has momentum. At the beginning of each subsequent quarter, the team that won the previous quarter is considered to have momentum, which grants each player a point of Edge that must be used on the opposed Teamwork test, or it is lost.

Record the number of net hits scored on each quarter’s test, as well as which side won the test. Take some time for the gamemaster and each player to describe their part in the game. If you’d like to resolve the game as quickly as possible, perhaps because the real focus of your session will be the events of the after-party, just make one of these tests every quarter, and whichever side ends up with the most hits wins by a margin appropriate to the difference in total net hits. However, in most cases it can be more fun to highlight key events within the game. After making the opposed Teamwork test, play through a key scene in detail. Whichever team wins the Teamwork test has momentum, which gives each player a situational Edge bonus for their part in the next opposed Teamwork test. If the PCs win the engagement, add three hits to their running score. If the opposing team gains the


---


You can use this framework to resolve any sports game, with adjustments for scoring to suit your taste. For more specific details about sports in the Sixth World, check out *No Future*.

The campaign won’t be entirely focused on the characters on the field, so most adventures will likely be centered on training for and playing games. Some suggestions for side adventures might involve social events dealing with the press, trying to woo the support of lucrative sponsorships, and engaging with rivals outside of the arena. Every sport has different types of seasons, but most have a regular season in which many teams compete for overall position going into the finals. The finals are usually an elimination tournament that culminates in a climactic final confrontation between the last two remaining teams. Your campaign might begin with a pre-season session, with a mock game that gives everyone a chance to get used to making Teamwork tests and roleplaying within this new context. Then play through a series of games, with opportunities for characters to engage in activities off the field. Track how well the team does over the course of the season for eight or so games. If the PCs’ team won more games than they lost, they may go into the playoffs. Otherwise, they do not qualify for the playoffs, and may look to next season for another chance. For the playoffs, play through at least three games. If the PCs lose a game, their team is eliminated. If they make it to the third game, they are competing for the championship. If they win that final game, they win the championship.

How much of this campaign focuses on the games versus the lives of the player characters is ultimately up to each group and what they are most interested in. Some players may wish to have a minimal focus on the sport and explore other aspects of the life of a celebrity athlete in the Sixth World. It’s a good idea to have a mix of sports-focused scenes and off-the-court scenes. This type of campaign is wide open to side events, such as having to survive in the wilderness after their plane or bus crashes on the way to a game, dealing with extortion attempts by organized crime, going on talk shows, or unusual teambuilding exercises in remote locations. Use these side events as a way to break things up between sports events and explore the lives and stories of the player characters.

Use the Slice-of-Life guidelines for Karma awards. Use Low lifestyle for amateur leagues, Middle lifestyle for college and illegal underground leagues, and High lifestyle for professional leagues. PCs make additional money through sponsorships and various indirect income streams that are dependent upon their team’s success. Whenever a game is resolved, each PC gains nuyen equal to the monthly cost of the campaign lifestyle. If their team won the game, they gain half their monthly lifestyle cost in bonuses. Special sponsorships might grant additional benefits for individual games, or on an ongoing basis, but these require special effort on behalf of the PCs, such as winning three or more games in a row, or making it all the way to the championship game. If a PC is benched for a game due to injuries or some other reason, they still collect pay for the game.

## Hopepunk

It can be fun playing a dark, gritty, dystopian future, but it can be even more fun to imagine how your characters might work to make that world a better place. The tone of a hopepunk campaign focuses on the idea that runners can make a difference with what they do. Individual runs should focus on helping individuals or working toward a positive cause. Characters might need to get creative about alternative revenue streams and may have to do some runs just to make money to get by. But most runs will involve hooding, which usually requires taking from the megacorps so you can give back to the people. This isn’t so much an alternative campaign as it is an alternative theme. Contacts become especially important, as they represent people who depend on assistance from the PCs as much as people to be leaned on for help and resources. This isn’t all sunshine and roses, though. Bad things will happen as the megacorporations, gangs, and crime syndicates all try to grind people under their boots, but the players should be able to fight back to avenge the wrongs they can’t right, and more importantly, help the people who are hurt and in need. Karma awards should be similar to a standard *Shadowrun* campaign, but with bonus Karma awarded for good deeds and advancing the cause of a better world.

## Player-Instigated Runs

Usually shadowrunners get involved in a run because a fixer or Mr. Johnson hired them. This is great for most sessions, but sometimes a player character or shadowrunner team has a personal goal they want to accomplish. This might be getting revenge against an enemy, stealing some gear that they couldn’t otherwise afford, helping out a contact, or even going on vacation. As a gamemaster, watch for opportunities to introduce these. As a player, let your gamemaster know if you think of something you would like to accomplish. It’s important to bring it up out-of-character so that your gamemaster has time to consider how to implement the idea. Don’t bring it up as an alternative idea to the run that your gamemaster has prepared for that day’s session. Karma awards for these runs should be based on the same scale as regular runs, but nuyen rewards are often absent. That’s okay. Not everything you do has to be about making money. Stealing an automotive facility sure might save you a lot of cash, though!

# EXTERIORS AND INTERIORS

**Posted by: DangerSensei**

They say you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. Most of the time, this is true. People walking by on the street, the Stuffer Shack attendant where you stop to get your soy wiener at three in the morning, or the folks crammed onto the tube with you just trying to get around town — you’ll probably never see each other again, so all you’re left with is that initial first impression. When these people look at you, what do they see? You can’t expect them to “gaze deeply into your soulful eyes to see the glowing individual beneath” or whatever. You’re more likely to have someone notice that stain on your coat or the horns on your head.

People tend to not notice the small things, the quirks. Nor do they understand others’ intent most of the time. They take a glance, filter what they see through their preconceptions, and that’s the reality they choose to believe. They look up from their commlink or come back from the glazed-over look of living in augmented reality, and they see a meta-human. Could be an ork, could be a human or an elf, could be a troll or a dwarf. Frag, these days it could be a sasquatch looking to score a bag of deepweed.

They see, and they react. If what they see is something they see every day, they aren’t going to give much attention. Sure, if they see a huge troll, they may refer to them as “big fella,” or they may act slightly intimidated if they see the toothy grin of an ork. People may give a second glance, or they may flinch, and we have learned to ignore it. Most of the time.

Look, as shadowrunners, we’re born to be iconoclasts. We always say that we don’t care about what other people think about us. That our style is all our own, and not influenced by anyone’s opinion. But let’s be honest — that’s pretty much drek. I can count on one hand the number of chummers I know who honestly don’t care what other people think.

How we’re seen by others matters more than we like to admit. It colors the way we dress, the


---


way we act, and who we feel we can talk to. We know, on a subconscious level, that appearance can make the difference between getting a job and not paying rent, or the difference between being singled out in a line or overlooked as just another wageslave.

If you believe the trids, the life of a runner is one big action scene. Guns blaze away, mages throw enormous bolts of lightning, stuff blows up, and everyone makes it home to their mansion for a round of Soyweiser or some other product from the program’s sponsor. There’s a long line of these shows, from *Sapphire: Shadowrunner for Hire* in the ’50s all the way through *Karl Kombatmage* and those popular P2.1 feeds. Every one of the runners in the shows looks like an underwear model. They all have the latest tech and toys, and no expense is spared. They dress in sleek, form-fitting catsuits, or flowing trench coats, and despite crawling through the muck of a sewer, their hair is never out of place, nor is their perfect makeup ever smudged. People get out of their way, recognize them wherever they go, and want to be them.

It’s the perfect corporate product, a slick sheen built on the fantasy of the downtrodden wageslave, polished to a mirror shine for the mass media. T-shirts, trideo games, and action figures abound, along with the latest streetpunk fashion. They rough the programs up enough to make them seem rebellious, but everyone knows the company still controls it. The punk trappings are for show—no one involved really wants to stick it to The Man, because The Man is paying them handsomely to make their shows and be some of the few people in the world who enjoy their work.

From the outside looking in, it’s easy to fall for that. The glitz, the glamour of the job, fighting injustice while making fat stacks of nuyen. Never having to take drek from some idiot on the street who mouths off one too many times. Best of all, being in control of their fate for once.

They never show the run where DocWagon won’t help your buddy who is bleeding out from a gunshot wound five meters away because he’s on corporate property. Absent is the runner who squats from night to night in different places, trying to stay one step ahead of the hit squad sent after him, even though he may have the money to buy a luxury condo in the best part of town. That coffin motel might not be a mansion, but it takes cash, has door locks, and a no-questions-asked policy.

They also never show the total drekheads who make snap judgments based on what you look like. People you actually sit down and deal with face to face, who have made their mind up about you before the first words are even spoken. The problem with these jerks is that they are way too common.

> Not to mention the assorted varieties of drekheads out there who will never look past your tusks, or horns, or ears. No matter what else you do, it just won’t matter to some people.  
> Bull

Mr. Johnson may see a team in street leathers coming into a meet in a fancy restaurant as inappropriate for the setting and may decide to pay them less, or not even hire them at all if the job he is looking to fill requires the team to blend in and adapt to surroundings. Not paying attention to little things like that makes the slobs look worse than just dirty street people. It makes them look unprofessional. Of course, if Mr. Johnson needs you to be noticed, dressing down may be a good way to make a statement. It’s all about time and place. Show up like that enough, and you may as well kiss your running prospects goodbye, unless all the work you do revolves around making a ton of noise.

So how do you know what type of team Mr. Johnson wants? The anonymity of the moniker definitely puts you behind the eight ball. Check your network of fixers, or talk to some of the runners who may have worked with them in the past. Runners live and die by their rep, and it’s the same for Johnsons.

The place where Mr. Johnson wants to meet can say a lot about what they are looking for. Check the Matrix for some pictures of the place, ask some people who may have been there, or just go do some good old-fashioned people watching. Blending in is a key skill of a shadowrunner.

> Legwork! Let me say that a few more times: legwork, legwork, legwork. If you’re smart, you’ll start digging up everything you can find about both the location and the prospective Mr. Johnson as soon as you get the call. That includes checking up on what rumors are floating around about the possible jobs out there. Secrets are hard to keep, and Mr. Johnson will have already been asking around to see what runners are best suited for a particular job long before the call is made.

While we may not be able to change what someone thinks initially when they first see us, we can change what we want them to see. We can change our mannerisms to blend in with our surroundings, or we can dress to what’s expected in whatever circumstance we’re heading into. We can choose to stand out and make an impression, either to shock or impress, or even to subvert and get an observer to either discount or otherwise underestimate us. Having that little bit of social know-how can go a long way to getting the right job, or getting overlooked by pursuers.

These days, we can take it much further than we could fifty years ago. Advances in cybertechnology allow for augmentations that not only cor-

Showing off a little implanted cold steel could make a potential employer decide you have what it takes to get something done. It helps that society is increasingly accepting of cyberware. Only in the stuffiest of areas will you get a sneering look from some fragger over flashing a little obvious cyber.

> If only! I’ve definitely seen cyberware be more accepted. But if you’re running with obvious chrome, you’d better be yerzing it out or some of the young bunch will just think you’re too poor to get good gear. And that is likely to lose you some gigs, or at least get you paid less.

Not to be outdone, advances in bioware and genetech have made what was formerly impossible possible, optimizing metahumanity through development of genetic tweaks and therapy. Tired of looking like you do? A phenotypic alteration can change the natural you to another version of yourself so far removed you wouldn’t even recognize yourself. Useful if your picture is everywhere and you need to burn an old identity. Can also help if you lost the SURGE lottery and want to get rid of some of the more extreme expressions that emerged.

You can take it past simple meetings and other social interactions too. See, there used to be this old piece of street wisdom. You may have heard it: “Geek the mage first!” or something like it. What if everyone looks like a mage? Or better yet, your mage just looks like another razorhead? It might not fool someone reading auras, but little things like these can save your hoop in a firefight.

The point of all of this is that the choices we make about how we appear to others can have a fraggin’ huge impact on how we do business, who we do business with, and how we bring home the bacon. You may have been born with an ugly mug, but it doesn’t mean you have to live with it. What you do have to live with are the consequences of how you carry yourself, both from within yourself and from anyone looking your way. It’s a game of smoke and mirrors, and sometimes you need to be seen just how you want to be.

# BUILDING YOUR RUNNER

When building a runner for *Shadowrun*, there are several things you will want to consider. Of course, you will want your runner to be able to perform their job effectively, but how they are seen and how they see themselves will direct what goes into the mix. In the Sixth World, appearance and style are much more prevalent than they would be in many other settings. Social interactions are how runners get jobs, avoid the cops, work contacts, and deal with many non-mission or run-related facets of their existence.

Things such as positive and negative qualities are easy to see as influential in this regard, but if you take things a step back and look at the wider picture, you can easily see how your character’s metatype and attributes can have a larger impact than you might think.

Metatypes should be carefully considered, as they can have a huge impact in terms of interactions with certain individuals one may encounter in a campaign. Choosing an elf because of their extra Agility but not considering other factors can be shortsighted, as your character may encounter anti-elven sentiment they weren’t prepared for or find themselves falling in with an elven-supremacist group like the Ancients.

Likewise, choosing a troll due to their resilience and strength may be fun for combat, but outside of combat, you might find yourself dissatisfied with paying more for everything and being on the receiving end of prejudice.

Going further, you could choose a metavariant of the standard metatypes. These are decidedly rarer and will surely catch the eyes of passersby, making a lasting impression on those who have seen them. This isn’t always what you want if you are working as a deniable asset, but sometimes you have to play the cards that are dealt to you.

Other, more exotic options, such as the Infected and centaurs and other metasapients, would definitely stand out. But more importantly, how they see themselves will greatly color how they interact with the world, and their worldview would be so vastly different from a more common metatype. These interactions would be both positive and negative, as these characters look to find their niche in the world.

Once you decide on a metatype, you can turn your attention to attributes. Some look at an attribute spread and simply see numbers. This one’s for shooting, this one’s for resisting damage, this one’s for Matrix actions, and so on. While they do in fact lend themselves to these actions mechanically, the numbers also measure how that character is viewed by others and how they see themselves.

A below-average or minimal statistic represents a weakness in the character. A low Strength means a physically weak character, unable to lift heavy objects. Conversely, a high Strength can denote a character with a musclebound appearance, or the presence of augmentations or other enhancements deceptively lying under a weaker-looking frame. Similarly, a low Reaction may reflect someone who is clumsy, and a low Agility could denote someone

whose manual dexterity leaves much to be desired. Remember, in the end, it is often a die roll that determines success or failure, and playing as if you have a high statistic when you really have a 1 is quite possibly going to lead to some problems.

A common tactic in character creation for tabletop roleplaying games is to take an undesired or commonly unused attribute, and “dump” it, meaning minimize it as much as possible, in favor of other attributes that reflect the most common actions in the game. In *Shadowrun* this is no different, but the setting, being such a large part of the game, discourages this to some degree. The setting itself is what sets *Shadowrun* apart from other games, in that it is a unique blending of genres, coming together in a widely relatable world. Interacting with this world in ways other than combat is one of the hallmarks of a complete *Shadowrun* experience, and a character who dumps stats at creation to focus only on combat may find themselves at a decided disadvantage regarding other, equally important aspects of the game. That’s not to say these skills couldn’t be developed later—after a few missions are under your belt, it’s an easy Karma expenditure to increase a very low attribute or skill. Alternatively, there may be a completely justified and in-character reason as to why the attributes turned out this way; it’s merely something to consider when creating a runner as a whole character rather than a walking weapons platform.

The next step to consider in building a runner is their qualities. These can easily be the drivers in how a character sees themselves, or how they are perceived by others.

Things such as Blandness, Distinctive Style, or Uncouth can dramatically alter how the character is regarded. Where a character who took Blandness will blend into the crowd easily, one with Distinctive Style would stand out and be noticed just passing by. This is the person with the lime-green mohawk and street leathers, walking past a corporate campus full of people in sharp business wear on their way to meetings or other engagements. Neither is wrong—one is much more memorable than the others and may have some preconceived notions about them, for better or for worse. Further, an extreme quality such as Uncouth can have detrimental effects on the entire team, as that runner would be a social boat anchor, dragging everyone down.

Those with a Distinctive Style may be seen as quirky or free spirited, or it may take a slightly darker turn with them being viewed as an outsider, someone who doesn’t belong, or a miscreant of some kind. The character may revel in both the positive and negative attention and may criticize those who decide to blend in as drones. In the worst case, the more conforming types may seek to silence the one who stands out, and unfortunately this has the potential for violence. It is something this character must be ready for at any time, and that realization has the possibility to make such a person seem reckless, or for them to feel paranoid and persecuted. Gamemasters should be careful about introducing elements such as this into a game; it has the potential to provide an interesting and layered experience, but it can also bring too much of the real world into a game where people are looking for an escape. Gamemasters should make sure players agree to have those sort of story elements as part of a campaign.

In the end, positive and negative qualities should be very carefully considered, as they could take the character in a direction that leads to some very intense situations and be rather restrictive. Engaging in behavior that reflects a negative quality without actually having it simply means you aren’t bound by a test to see if your character is compelled to perform in that way. Your runner getting smashed on Soyweiser and appletinis once in a while doesn’t mean they have the Addiction quality.

Staying in the same vein of how a character sees themselves, if they do not feel they are strong or fast enough, augmentations are often the answer. Permanent alterations to the character’s body are surprisingly commonplace in the world of *Shadowrun*, with the most common being limb replacements or a Matrix interface, such as a datajack or cybereyes with an image link. Reflex augmentations to make a character the fastest gun in the West are also very popular with runners and combat types, with the idea that someone you shoot first won’t be able to shoot you.

The presence of cyberware creates the ubiquitous aesthetic associated with the genre of *Shadowrun*. Augmentations on anyone from cab drivers to salarymen to street gangers are common. Everyone seems to have a way to interact with the Matrix, and interact with it so often that those without augmentation are almost considered dinosaurs, left in the dark world of no augmented reality, without the glitzy overlays hiding the grunge of street life.

Other augmentations in the form of bioware, genetic enhancements, or even nanoware can drastically affect how runners see themselves, or how they are seen by others. For example, certain bioware makes its user eat twice as much to power the implanted systems. For the most part, though, these types of augmentations are not visible to the casual observer, and many runners like to use this to their advantage, concealing their strength as opposed to wearing it on their shiny cyberarms.

Beyond the appearance of the runner, it is also important to consider who they associate with. Contacts can be the difference between going into a situation blind and knowing what you are getting into. The amount of information that can be gleaned from contacts is often overlooked in favor of the services.

**EXTERIORS AND INTERIORS // BUILDING YOUR RUNNER**

they provide, such as a street doc or a fixer who can score some high-availability gear. That beat cop you have as a contact may be good for looking up criminal histories and possible locations of gangers, but they can also help you dodge getting hauled off to the city joint, if they happen to be in the area. That talismonger can sell you a few pieces of choice magical goods, but it may be their knowledge of the occult, or even the memory of some Yakuza thug who came in to buy something three weeks ago, that could make a major break in your run. The homeless guy who squats in a nearby garage can tell you who came by and broke into the Stuffer Shack. The list can keep going, and every contact has a use. Never underestimate the power of information.

When all the gear is purchased, all the augmentations are implanted, and the ammo is loaded onto the character sheet, there is still one more thing to purchase: Lifestyle. Often this is forgotten in character creation, but it is important, as a runner’s lifestyle can have a large effect on their appearance, who they interact with on a daily basis, and how they conduct business.

A runner with a Street lifestyle is likely going to be dirty and unkempt, having spent time sleeping in doorways and alleyways. They have probably been chased out of public spaces by some overzealous cop or prejudiced business owner. It is likely they don’t have much, or anything, in the way of fancier clothes, and their general appearance may be unsettling for those who don’t deal with street-level people every day.

On the other hand, a runner who has taken a High or Luxury lifestyle would have all the gadgets associated with it. Expensive clothes, flashy cars, brand names emblazoned on their custom gear, and so on. While they may not face the same prejudices as someone living on the Street, they would be disadvantaged going into a part of town that doesn’t reflect their affluence. Showing up in a Eurocar Westwind to the heart of the barrens is asking to find it stripped and on blocks after an hour or so. Flashing nuyen around makes the runner a target for gangs looking to score some beer money, and business owners may resent some rich jerk who comes to their neck of the woods and throws their weight around.

Carefully considering this puts a decent image in the mind of what the runner will look like, what their job will be, and how they will carry themselves. If you wanted to take it a step further and really flesh things out, look to the final capstone for creating a runner: the Twenty Questions.

BUILDING YOUR RUNNER // EXTERIORS AND INTERIORS


---


# Twenty Questions

Your character is more than just a series of numbers and a pile of gear. The decisions you make in play will come from the experiences the character went through to get to where they are. You can build a story for a character with the help of this brief questionnaire.

1. Nature has gifted us with our base set of genetics. We are born with a set of facial features, skin tone, height, build, metatype, and even aptitudes. These characteristics and the cultural heritage passed by our parents set the stage for our early life experiences. Where does your character come from, what is their lineage, who were their parents, and what did they inherit from them?

2. Nurture makes its mark on our attitude and response to the world. Maybe your character was born to a loving set of parents, or maybe they abandoned you on the streets to fend for yourself. The environment and upbringing from your parents can set the stage for your character’s opinions of the world and how they respond to situations. Assuming they could speak, what would each of your character’s parents say about them?

3. Some historical events leave a mark and shape us in profound ways. Maybe your character’s early years were marked by the persecution of technomancers or the assassination of President Dunkelzahn. Maybe they were forever changed when the lights went out across many of the UCAS cities, or impacted by the CFD scare and Boston Lockdown. Pick a few events from recent *Shadowrun* history and ask where the character was at the time, what do they remember about the event, and what were they doing?

4. Not many people choose to be in the glorious job of a deniable asset. Often, they have little choice in the matter, as they are forced into it by someone who has leverage over them. Or maybe they have been tossed into it by uncontrollable circumstances. Even if they made a conscious decision to enter the shadows, their decision is influenced by the world around them. How did your character get into shadowrunning, and why did they take that path?

5. A doss isn’t just where your character catches some shut-eye. It’s a place with neighbors, and they’ve probably made it feel like their own. Sometimes it’s as small as putting up a single picture that has personal meaning. Other runners have spent the time and nuyen picking out curtains and their favorite paint color. Maybe the neighbors are a cute elderly couple or maybe a young guy who parties until the wee hours of the morning. What has your character done to their living space?

6. Everyone has beliefs and convictions that animate their life. Some are religious, some are political, some are social, and some are just about why people are here. Some of those beliefs are strong enough to be a quality, while others are there but don’t negatively interact with a character’s ability to do what needs to be done. What does your character believe in, what are their convictions, and why do they hold them?

7. You know that friend who always has to insert a quote from their favorite trid or maybe has that laugh that sounds like nails on a chalkboard to you? What flaws does your character have that sets others on edge? What do you dislike most about your character’s personality?

8. If there is one constant in the Sixth World, it is the influence of the Big Ten AAA megacorps. These transnationals dominate everyday life in the 2080s. They’re everywhere—from everyone’s favorite trids to what they eat for breakfast. Are there any of the Big Ten that your character hates, and why? Are there are some they don’t mind or even like?

9. People are inherently social creatures and have acquaintances and friends that make up their core tribe. This is especially true in the shadows, where often it is not the power you have, but the power you can borrow, and not who you are but who you know. There’s a story behind each and every one of these relationships. What is the story with your character and their contacts?

10. Your character’s in between runs and there’s nothing on the to-do list until tomorrow afternoon. They might go hit the range, or maybe they run downtown to catch a combat biker match. What do they do for the day?

11. Your character has specific skills, abilities, and knowledge. Their list of Active and Knowledge skills defines what they know and their areas of expertise. How did they come to learn those skills, and how did they develop them to those levels?

12. Maybe your character calls it their moral code, or maybe they just know what line


---


they aren’t willing to cross. Everyone has their limits. Maybe your character won’t do wetwork or maybe they draw the line at taking money from orphans. Is there a moral limit that your character enforces on the jobs they take? In what shadow work would they refuse to engage?

13. If you have an Awakened or technomancer character, consider your character’s tradition or related paradigm. Even within the major established magical traditions and technomantic streams, they may have their own way of doing things. What drew your character to that particular paradigm, how does it affect the way they view the world and their abilities? How does it translate into their choice of mentor spirit or paragon, and how does it affect the appearance of the spirits or sprites they conjure or compile?

14. Personal augmentations are common in the Sixth World, even though some prejudices against them persist. Cyberware and bioware are rarely cheap, and many augmentations are illegal or require licenses. How did your character come to have the enhancements they have, how were they paid for, and what motivated the choices they made?

15. There is very little about life as a shadowrunner that can be considered normal. Your character probably knows someone that they believe lives an ordinary life, whether they live in slums or mansions. What does your character think of ordinary life, mainstream culture, and those who abide by it?

16. Sometimes our fears drive us to do things we aren’t proud of. Other times, they prevent us from doing the things others depend on us for. What deep-seated fear or recurring nightmare does your character have, and why do they find it so terrifying?

17. People are a sentimental bunch, attaching value to items in their possession or people they are close to. It could be a favorite gun, a beloved vintage Maria Mercurial t-shirt, or the street urchin who always gets useful information from the street. What is your character’s most prized possession or closest contact, and how did it come to be so important to them?

# GAMEMASTER OPTIONS: KARMA FOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

Players who come to the table with fully fleshed out characters add a lot of role-play hooks. The non-player characters in your campaign will be able to interact in more complex ways when a character is more detailed. Each of the questions can introduce new story hooks and subplot ideas to add within your campaign. In addition, finding ways for the characters to care about something in the story becomes easier with the character’s motivations.

Sometimes as the gamemaster, you may feel extra generous. Knowing that answering the twenty questions adds value to the game, you might want to offer something of value in return. Rewarding players with a Karma bonus for the time they put into their characters and the campaign may encourage them to participate. While 1 Karma per question is probably a bit much, an option could be to assign two questions between each game session, and give 1 Karma so they can progress gradually over the course of the campaign. Alternatively, you could offer 3 Karma at character generation for completing ten questions thoughtfully.

18. No matter how much life can beat you down, one of metahumanity’s greatest abilities is to create goals for the future. Everyone has dreams, from little kids to grown adults to weary elders. What did your character want to become when they were younger, and do they have new goals now?

19. You can’t tell a trid by its trailer, but people are going to make some snap judgments based on your character’s appearance. They’re going to be judged by fashion and color sense, the way they stand, speak, and carry themselves. What does your character look like, and what inspired their choices?

20. Real names have power, so most runners go by some moniker. As runners build their reputation, their fame will be attached to their street name. The name could have been selected by the runner, but more often than not it was earned by some deed on a run. How did your character come to be known by their street name?

# SHADOWRUN: SIXTH WORLD COMPANION

## EXTERIORS AND INTERIORS // BUILDING YOUR RUNNER

# BUILDING A SHADOW

Shadowrun allows players to create detailed, unique, interesting, and effective characters. You aren’t restricted to a specific archetype or class, and you’re free to prioritize the different components of character creation as you choose. The character creation chapter of *Shadowrun, Sixth World* (p. 58) provides a standard set of rules for creating a character, in which you assign a priority to each of five different categories. This chapter presents three alternative character creation methods that allow for either greater customization (in the case of Sum-to-Ten or Point Buy) or, in the case of the life modules system, help you build a narrative background as you build your character.

## Sum-to-Ten

If you’re looking for a little extra customization than the priority system allows you to achieve, Sum-to-Ten is an easy alternative. Sum-to-Ten is a modified approach to the priority system. Normally you must assign one A, one B, one C, one D, and one E to each of the five categories.  

If you’re looking for a little extra customization than the priority system allows you to achieve, Sum-to-Ten is a modified approach to the priority system. Normally you must assign one A, one B, one C, one D, and one E to each of the five categories.  

Using Sum-to-Ten, you have ten points to use to purchase five priorities. Assigning priority E costs no points, D costs 1 point, C costs 2 points, B costs 3 points, and A costs 4 points. You may have any combination of letters, as long as their point values add up to 10.  

For example:  
* Two priorities at A, two at D, and one at E  
* Five priorities at C  
* Three priorities at B, one at D, and one at E  
* One at A, three at C, and one at E  

Just as with the priority system, you only assign one letter to each priority, and every priority must be assigned a letter.  

Once you’ve assigned your priorities, you gain the appropriate attributes, skills, resources, special attribute points, and Awakened or Emerged abilities for the priority choices that you made.  

Then continue to step three of character creation (p. 66), to purchase qualities, buy gear, contacts, knowledge/language skills, and spend your 50 customization Karma.


---


# Sum-to-Ten Character Creation Example One

Let’s design a rigger with some social skills. It will be important to have decent attributes and skills, as well as plenty of nuyen. The Awakened/Emerged category is completely unimportant in this case, and we can afford to make the metatype adjustment points category a low priority as well. For four points, we’ll assign A to resources, giving us 450,000 nuyen to buy our expensive augmentations, gear, vehicles, and drones. For three points each, we get priority B in both attributes and skills. That leaves us with no more points, so we take priority E in metatype and Magic/Resonance. If we had used the normal priority system, we would have had to settle for priority C in either attributes or skills, though we would have more metatype adjustment points to spend.

With these Sum-to-Ten priority choices, we can build our rigger with 16 attribute points, 24 skill ranks, 450,000 nuyen, and 1 metatype or special attribute adjustment point. For metatype, we select human, and assign that adjustment point to give a final Edge of 2. For our attributes, we’ll go with Body 1, Agility 1, Reaction 3, Strength 1, Willpower 3, Logic 6, Intuition 4, Charisma 5. We’ll use up a fair bit of our 50 customization Karma advancing our Body and Agility later. For skills, we’ll go with Con 4, Engineering 5 with a specialization in gunnery, Perception 4, Piloting 6, Stealth 4. For our gear, we can either choose the Transport Rigger PACK or the Drone Rigger PACK (p. 55), which will set us up with all the augmentations, vehicles, drones, and other gear we’ll need. We still need to choose our contacts, knowledge skills, languages, and qualities, and we’ll also spend our 50 customization Karma. Let’s be vague about which qualities are selected, except that the Karma costs and bonuses balanced each other out. Then all of our 50 Karma is spent to buy our Body and Agility up to 3. It would have been nice to start with an Influence skill, but we’ll have to pick that up later. Due to our Charisma of 5, we have 30 contact points to spend, so we’ll start with a range of well-connected and loyal contacts. Our Logic provides us with six knowledge or language skills in addition to our native language. We shall leave the specific details of those choices up to your imagination. The key to this example is that we were able to adjust our character priorities just a little bit in order to make the priority choices more to our liking.

# Sum-to-Ten Character Creation Example Two

For our second example, we’re going to make a mundane but very skilled and capable character with a noir detective theme. Priority A is assigned to attributes for four points, and we also go with priority A for skills for another four of our Sum-to-Ten points. This leaves us with 2 points, which we use to assign priority C to resources. This leaves us with no other choice than to assign priority E to both metatype adjustment points and Magic/Resonance. Now we can build our character with 24 attribute points, 32 skill ranks, 150,000 nuyen, and 1 metatype adjustment point. For metatype, let’s go with a dwarf. Our attributes are Body 5, Agility 6, Reaction 4, Strength 1, Willpower 3, Logic 4, Intuition 5, Charisma 4, and Edge 2. For skills, Athletics 4, Con 5, Firearms 5, Outdoors 4, Perception 5, Influence 5, Stealth 4. Even though we’re mundane, the gunslinger adept PACK (p. 51) is a good fit for us and covers most of our gear needs for 50,000 nuyen. We’ll use most of the rest of our 100,000 nuyen on augmentations, which gets us used wired reflexes 2 and some really nice cybereyes. With the Sum-to-Ten part of the process done, we move on to the rest of character creation.

## Point Buy

Use the Point Buy system when you want to make a highly customized character and don’t mind spending some extra time working out the points to get it just the way you want it.

Point Buy replaces step two of character creation, using character points (CP for short) to build your character instead of assigning priorities.

Character points are different than any other resource in *Shadowrun*. They are only used during character creation and only when you are using the Point Buy system.

Shadowrunners are built with 100 CP. All of your CP must be spent finishing your character; none of it can carry over in any way. You still gain 50 points of customization Karma, which you may use as you see fit during step four.

## Choose your Metatype/Metavariant

Choose the metatype or metavariant you wish to play. Some of these may require a Karma cost, which is deducted from your 50 points of available customization Karma. Any metagenetic qualities must also be paid for (though in some cases they may contribute to your customization Karma).

Your choice of metatype, metavariant, or any of the other options available to you does not cost any CP, no matter what it might be. All costs for such choices are paid for with customization Karma. Some alternate character types, such as shifters or Infected, may not be available to play in every campaign. If you wish to choose one of these, be sure to discuss it with your gamemaster. Not every gamemaster will be comfortable allow-


---


# Choose Mundane, Awakened, or Emerged  
_(MUST choose one, and only one)_:  
* Mundane: 0 CP  
* Awakened or Emerged: 10 CP  

Choose type: full magician, mystic adept, adept, aspected magician, or technomancer  
- Technomancers start with Resonance 1.  
- Full magicians, adepts, and mystic adepts start with Magic 1.  
- Aspected magicians start with a Magic 2.  
- Magic and Resonance attributes may be increased by using special/metatype adjustment points.  
- If you choose adept or mystic adept, this unlocks the ability to purchase adept power points (PP) for 4 CP each (8 CP each for mystic adepts). You may only purchase as many PP as your final Magic rating.  
- Choosing technomancers unlocks complex forms, and spells are unlocked for full magicians, mystic adepts, and aspected magicians.  
- Magicians, mystic adepts, and aspected magicians may purchase a number of spells, alchemical formulas, and rituals up to their final Magic × 2 (mystic adepts subtract PP from Magic for this calculation). These cost either 2 CP or 5 Karma each.  
- Technomancers may purchase a number of complex forms up to their final Resonance × 2. These cost either 2 CP or 5 Karma each.  

> **Note:** Characters do *not* start with any power points, spells, or complex forms without purchasing them with CP or Karma.

## Purchase Special/Metatype Adjustment Points with CP  
All characters start with 1 metatype adjustment point for free. You may purchase up to 12 additional adjustment points at 4 CP each. Each of these points may be used to increase any of the following attributes by one: Edge, Magic (Awakened only), Resonance (Emerged only), or any attribute with a maximum higher than 6 for your metatype. These points may *not* be used to increase any other attributes.

## Purchase Attributes with CP  
All character attributes start at the minimum for their metatype, which is always 1. All characters start with 4 attribute points. You may purchase up to 20 additional attribute points for 2 CP each. For each attribute point, you may increase any of the following attributes by one: Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength, Willpower, Logic, Intuition, and Charisma. Only one of your attributes may be increased to its maximum at character creation. These attribute points may not be used to increase Edge, Magic, or Resonance.

## Purchase Skills with CP  
All characters start with 12 skill points. You may purchase up to 20 additional skill points at the cost of 2 CP each. For each skill point, you may gain a new skill at rank one, increase a skill by one rank, or learn a specialization in one of your skills.  
> **Note:** You may only have one skill at its maximum starting rank at character creation (6, or 7 with the Aptitude quality). You may also have no more than one specialization at character creation.

## Purchasing Resources with CP  
All characters start with 10,000 nuyen. You may purchase up to 440,000 additional nuyen worth of resources at 20,000 nuyen per CP.  
> **Note:** You may not keep more than 5,000 nuyen in cash after character creation. If you are new to *Shadowrun* or wish to save some time on this part, check out the PACKs starting on p. 49 of this book.  

Once you have spent all your character points, continue to step three of character creation in the core rule book (p. 66), to buy gear and use your remaining customization Karma to purchase advancements, qualities, contacts, knowledge skills, and languages.

## Point Buy Example  
Let’s build a technomancer using the point-buy system. It costs 10 of our 100 points to be Emerged, which provides us with a Resonance attribute of 1. We know we’re going to want that to be higher, so 5 special attribute points costs us 20 more character points, bringing our total spent to 30. We get one free special attribute point, which can be used to raise our Edge to 2, but we’ll spend another 4 CP to raise it up to 3 (total CP currently spent is 34). Attributes and skills are going to be important as well, but resources not so much. For our attributes, we end up with Body 1, Agility 1, Reaction 4, Strength 1, Willpower 5, Logic 6, In-

tuition 5, Charisma 5. This requires 20 attribute points. Since we get four for free, we only need to buy 16 attribute points for 32 CPs. Having spent 66 of our 100 CPs, we’ll dump the remaining 34 points into buying 17 skill points. Counting our 12 free skill points, that gives us 29 skill points to spend on Athletics 4, Cracking 6, Electronics 5, Perception 3, Stealth 5, and Tasking 5 with a specialization in Compiling. With no CPs invested in resources, we’ll have to make do with 10,000 nuyen unless we use our Karma for more money. With all of our CP assigned along with our attribute and skill choices, we move on to the remaining character creation steps. We’ll spend 10 of our Karma to raise our Body to 2, and 25 more to raise our Agility up to 3. We’ll use our remaining 15 Karma to acquire three complex forms because we didn’t spend any CP on those. Since we’re dirt poor, we’ll pick the Dirt Poor PACK for 8,000 nuyen and hang onto the remaining 2,000 to start with some cash. All that’s left to do is choose our qualities (which in this example will balance out to cost us zero Karma), contacts, and our knowledge and language skills.

# LIFE PATH

The Life Path system provides an alternative to character creation in which you choose which experiences and events make up your character’s history and background. These choices provide you with various options to choose your starting attributes, skills, resources, and contacts.

Unlike Sum-to-Ten and Point Buy, which merely replace a single step of the character creation rules from the core rulebook, the Life Path system takes over most of the process.

Creating a character using the Life Path system should result in an effective and well-rounded character that reflects the choices your character made throughout their life. You are less likely to end up with a highly specialized character that is extremely good at one thing, and not much else. But there are many choices to be made. What story will you tell as you create your shadowrunner?

When creating a character using the Life Path system, you must first make some choices based on your character’s birth and childhood. The first three life modules are: Born This Way, Growing Up, and Coming of Age. These will determine your metatype, whether you are mundane, Awakened, or Emerged, and some of your starting skills and attributes.

After this, you will select eight life modules from a much wider range of possibilities.

All characters begin with 50 Karma that may be used to customize your character. Don’t spend this Karma until after you assign all of your life modules, with two exceptions: Karma can be spent


---


on your qualities and on any metavariant Karma costs. Some life modules provide you with a quality. When you choose a positive quality, deduct its Karma cost from your available Karma. When you choose a negative quality, add Karma to your total.

When choosing qualities, there are several limitations. You may not end up with more than six total qualities at character creation (not including qualities granted by metatype). If you choose a life module that would give you a seventh quality, you must either choose not to take that quality or replace one of your previously selected qualities. If you replace a quality, refund any Karma costs from that quality. Quality paths do not count toward this limit. Also, you may not gain more than 20 bonus Karma from your qualities after deducting the costs of any positive qualities. If you choose so many negative qualities that you would get more Karma than that, you do not get that Karma.

When choosing attributes and skills, there are limitations. Only one of your standard attributes (Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength, Willpower, Logic, Intuition, and Charisma) may be set to its maximum for your metatype. Your Magic or Resonance attribute may be no higher than 6. Only one skill may be at its maximum rank (usually 6 at character creation, unless a quality allows an exception).

When you gain resources from a life module, don’t spend them right away. Keep a running total. You will spend your nuyen to purchase your lifestyle and gear once you have completed your life path.

## Contacts

Many life modules provide you with 2 or 4 contact points, which may be used to purchase or upgrade contacts. Each contact point can be used to increase a contact’s Loyalty or Connection rating by one. You may spend 2 contact points to purchase a new contact, with Loyalty and Connection ratings of 1 each. You may only spend contact points to purchase or upgrade contacts with a type that matches the life module that provided the contact points.

You may spend contact points to upgrade a contact with a type that doesn’t match the life module you chose, but only if that contact has one type. When you do this, your contact gains a second type that matches the life module that provided the contact points.

No contact may have a final Connection or Loyalty rating higher than 8.

Unlike other character creation methods, your Charisma does not provide you with contact points, and your contacts’ ratings are not limited by your Charisma attribute. Your initial free contacts are provided by your life module choices.

You may spend your customization Karma to upgrade your contacts if you choose. It costs 1 Karma per Connection or Loyalty rating. However, you may not use Karma to upgrade any contact’s Connection or Loyalty rating any higher than your Charisma attribute.

## Knowledge and Language Skills

Some life modules grant you one or two knowledge or language skills. These modules each list a few specific knowledge skills. These knowledge skills are only suggestions. You may choose a different knowledge skill than is listed on a module or even make up your own. If you choose a language skill, you may select a new language at rank 1 or increase the rank of a language you already know, up to a maximum of rank 3. Because you gain knowledge and language skills through your life modules, you do not gain additional ones based on your Logic attribute.

> ### Purchasing and Advancing Language Skills
>
> All characters, regardless of what character creation system is used, begin with a single language at level 4 (Native).
>
> Purchasing a new language skill at level 1 (Basic) costs 3 Karma. For 2 Karma, you may upgrade a language skill rank to 2 (Specialist), and again up to a maximum level 2 (Expert).
>
> The Polyglot quality reduces these costs by 1 Karma each and allows you to improve multiple languages to level 4 (Native).

## Adept Powers, Complex Forms, and Spells

Magicians (both full and aspected) gain a number of spells (including formulas and rituals) equal to the rating of their Magic attribute. Additional spells may be purchased for 5 Karma each, with a maximum number of them equal to Magic × 2.

Adepts gain a number of power points for adept powers equal to the rating of your Magic attribute.

Mystic adepts must choose whether to gain a power point or spell for each point of Magic. You may purchase additional power points and spells for 5 Karma each, with a maximum number of power points equal to Magic, and a maximum number of spells equal to Magic × 2.

Technomancers gain a number of complex forms equal to Resonance and may purchase additional complex forms (up to a maximum of Resonance × 2) for 5 Karma each.

LIFE PATH // BUILDING A SHADOW

# Starting Down  
## The Life Path

All characters begin their life path with these three initial life modules.

### Born This Way

The first life module represents the defining circumstances of your birth. They mostly relate to the body you were born with, but also determine whether you will be mundane, Awakened, or Emerged.

- Choose your metatype, metavariant, and any metagenetic qualities. You must pay the Karma costs, or note any Karma bonuses, from these choices.
- Next, choose whether you are mundane, Awakened, or Emerged.
- Any attributes for which your metatype has an increased maximum (higher than six) start at 2. All other attributes start at 1.
- If you’re Emerged, gain Resonance 1.
- If you’re a full magician, mystic adept, or adept, gain Magic 1.
- If you’re an aspected magician, gain Magic 2.
- If you are not Awakened or Emerged, add one to your Edge attribute.
- Choose your nationality of birth.
- Choose a language skill to gain at level 4 (Native).
- Choose one or two qualities that your character believes they were born with. If you choose two qualities, one must be a positive quality and the other must be a negative quality. The Karma cost and bonus do not need to match. Pay any Karma costs and gain any bonus Karma from your qualities.
- Define your character’s best attribute (cannot be Edge, Magic, or Resonance). Increase that attribute by 5. If the maximum for that attribute for your metatype is 5, set it to 5 and raise another attribute of your choice by 1.
- Choose one or two qualities that define something important about who you are. These may be positive or negative qualities. Deduct or increase your available Karma due to any costs or bonuses from these qualities.
- Gain 25,000 nuyen in resources. Do not spend this immediately. Keep a running total of your nuyen throughout your life path, and purchase your gear once every module has been chosen.
- Gain one contact of any type (Academic, Corporate, Criminal, Engineering, Government, Magic, Matrix, Media, Medical, or Street). Assign four total points among their Connection and Loyalty ratings, with a minimum of 1 to each. This represents an individual that you have known for a very long time.

### Growing Up: Early Childhood and Adolescence

As you grew up, you learned a few basic skills. Choose four of the following skills: Athletics, Close Combat, Con, Electronics, Influence, Outdoors, Perception, and Stealth. You gain each of the chosen skills at rank 2. These represent skills learned throughout your childhood.

- You may also choose one or two qualities that resulted from your experiences as an adolescent child. Pay or gain Karma equal to the quality’s cost. If you choose two qualities, one must be positive and the other negative.
- Gain the [Area] Knowledge skill about the place you grew up.

### Coming of Age: Early Adult and the Transition to Adulthood

Choose any one skill that represents your strongest talent. Gain that skill at rank 4. If it is one of the skills you chose in the previous module, increase it to rank 6.

- Gain one contact of any type (Academic, Corporate, Criminal, Engineering, Government, Magic, Matrix, Media, Medical, or Street). Assign four total points among their Connection and Loyalty ratings, with a minimum of 1 to each. This represents an individual that you have known for a very long time.

### Adult Life Modules

Next, choose eight life modules that represent your most significant adult experiences. These life modules might represent education, time spent pursuing a career, noteworthy events, and other life choices. The time each life module takes is flexible based on how you imagine your story. An event might be a single moment that changed the course of your life, or years of personal effort. A career choice might represent years of experience, or perhaps just several intense months. The story is yours to tell. You may select life modules in whatever order you wish, but the order represents how your life progressed. If you went to the academy before you got a corporate security job, take Academy Training before you take the Security Guard module. You must take exactly eight life modules. You may take one—and only one—module twice.

Most life modules provide you with several choices. You must select an option from each choice that is presented you.

Life modules fall into two broad categories: choices and events. Choices usually represent time spent pursuing a career, and events represent things that happened to you. You may mix and match them to make up your eight modules as you choose.

An event life module represents a significant occurrence that shaped your life rather than a vocation or period of education. These events are usually jarring and highly unpleasant to live through, but they shape the decisions you make going forward. An event might be a sudden occurrence, or it could be a slow escalation, or even just a set of circumstances that shaped you. Contact points from events may only be used to upgrade the Con-

A social or political cause became extremely important to you, and you threw yourself into doing whatever you could to advance it.

The study of alchemy or enchanting became all-consuming for a time. You spent many hours within your magical laboratory (others might call it a lodge, but not you), designing alchemical preparations that would allow you to instill your spells into physical objects for later release. This fascinating new magical study is often overlooked by traditionalist magicians, but you saw its true potential.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Edge, Magic, Willpower, or your other drain attribute  
* **Choose one:** +2 to Astral or Enchanting

---


# Blue-Collar Laborer
There’s money to be made doing physical labor for the megacorps. As long as you don’t mind long hours, hazardous working conditions, and a whole lot of micro-management. It was a paycheck, and an honest one, but you earned every nuyen several times over.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Body, Strength, or Willpower  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Agility, Intuition, or Reaction  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Electronics, Engineering, Outdoors, or Perception

* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Engineering, Government  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** [Area] Knowledge, [Sprawl] Streets, Trideo Series, [Industry] Expert, or one level in any language skill.

# Bodyguard
You learned how to spot trouble and keep your clients out of it. Most of the time. Sometimes you took the hit for your client, but that’s all in a day’s work as a bodyguard.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Body, Agility, or Strength  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Edge, Intuition, or Reaction  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Close Combat, Firearms, or Perception  
* **Resources:** +25,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 4  
* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Criminal, Government, Street

# Bounty Hunter
You made your living hunting down metahuman prey and turning them over to whoever was willing to pay you. Sometimes this was a criminal wanted by law enforcement, but more often than not it was a megacorporation securing a stray asset. The other times, for individual clients, were some of the worst. Good money, though. Maybe good enough to forget the faces of the people you turned over to the mercies of the vengeful wealthy and powerful.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Agility, Reaction, or Intuition  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Outdoors, Perception, or Stealth  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Athletics, Close Combat, Firearms, or Edge  
* **Resources:** +25,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Criminal, Street  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** [Area] Gangs, Law Enforcement Corps, Wanted Criminals, or one level in any language skill.

# Celebrity
Whether born to privilege or stumbling upon fame, you lived life in the spotlight for a time. Sure the perks were great—luxury restaurants, high-profile parties, and nuyen flowing through and around you like a river. But it wasn’t all sunshine and novacoke. Your life quickly became no longer your own, as you represented revenue streams for the corps. Before long, every part of your day was carefully scheduled for maximum profit. Sure, you got a lot out of it, but it cost you everything else.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Charisma, Intuition, or Edge  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Con, Influence, or Perception  
* **Resources:** +50,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 4  
* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Media

# Charlatan
Some might say that magic’s return to the world is old news, status quo, and a known quantity. You found this assumption to be flawed. Despite how much magic is studied and understood, so much mystery remains, and many people hold to superstitious beliefs or fabricate new ones. Whether you pretended to have magic ability, or represented your magic as being more than it was ever capable of, you found useful tools to exploit others. It made you a lot of nuyen, but there are probably a few people you hope you never bump into again.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Edge, Magic (Awakened only), or Charisma  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Con, Influence, or Stealth  
* **Resources:** +50,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Criminal, Magic  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Arcana, Espionage Techniques, Magical Societies, or one level in any language skill.

# Clairvoyant [Awakened Only]
Magic has many uses, and while many are wowed by flashing fireballs, scintillating illusions, or levitation, you found that what interested you the most was its ability to reveal mysteries and un-

* Choose one: +1 to Edge, Magic, or Reaction

* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Magic  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Arcana, Magical Traditions, Metaplanes, or one level in any language skill  

## Coach/Trainer  
You aren’t just good at sports. You’re good at working with people and bringing out their best performance. Good enough to make a living at it, and a pretty good one while it lasted. And it wasn’t just your clients that benefited—you had to stay in peak condition as well.  
* Choose one: +1 to Body, Agility, or Strength  
* Choose one: +1 to Reaction, Intuition, or Charisma  
* Choose one: +1 to Athletics, Con, or Influence

* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Criminal, Government  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Educational Theory, Fitness, Combat Biker, Urban Brawl, or one level in any language skill  

## College/University  
You attended a school of academic study and spent many long hours preparing for grueling exams. You gained much knowledge, and it provided you with some career options. That, and lots of student loan debt.  
* Choose one: +1 to Charisma, Intuition, Logic, or Willpower  
* Choose one: +2 to Biotech, Con, Electronics, or Influence  
* Choose one: +1 to Biotech, Con, Electronics, or Influence  
* **Knowledge skills:** Choose up to two academic knowledge skills (biology, economics, law, mathematics, etc.), or levels in language skills  

## Cook/Chef  
Everyone needs to eat, and cooks are always in demand. It was steady money, though it never paid very well. Still, you met some good people and learned a few things. Anyone can microwave a soy-rito, but with your skills and a few basic ingredients you can create something actually worth eating.  
* Choose one: +1 to Body, Agility, or Intuition  
* Choose one: +1 to Charisma, Edge, or Logic  
* Choose one: +1 to Close Combat, Con, Outdoors, or Perception  
* **Resources:** +25,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Academic, Corporate, Street  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Cuisine, [Area] Nightclubs, or one rank in any language skill  

## Counter-Hacker  
Most security spiders are content to remain on defense, waiting to react to threats as they become known. Your job was a bit more proactive, which was to anticipate and counter active Matrix threats. You spent long hours tracking down data havens and learning everything you could about what shadow operations were underway, but eventually you found you identified more with the people you were hired to oppose than the ones you worked for. Things got pretty interesting after that.  
* Choose one: +1 to Intuition, Reaction, or Willpower  
* Choose one: +1 to Edge, Resonance, or +25,000 nuyen  
* Choose one: +1 to Electronics, Cracking, or Tasking  
* Choose one: +1 to Engineering, Perception, Stealth  
* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Government, Matrix  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Matrix Host Design, Notorious Hackers, Security Systems, or one rank in any language skill  

## Courier  
Getting things from one place to another is usually accomplished over the Matrix or by shipping company, but not when it’s illegal, sensitive, or too important to be trusted to risk interception. That was your niche as a courier. You took the thing to the destination, no questions asked or answered. You had to learn how to stay under the radar, spot trouble before it spots you, and get around without being tracked by whoever wanted what you carried.

* Contact Points: 2  
* Contact Types: Corporate, Criminal, Government  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Espionage Techniques, Smuggling Routes, [Sprawl] Streets, or one rank in any language skill  

## Covert Ops  
Megacorps, governments, and even organized crime syndicates sometimes need to conduct delicate and discreet operations without anyone else ever finding out about it. Sometimes they hire shadowrunners, but it’s even more useful to have your own personnel that are dedicated to your cause. You spent some time working covert operations for one of these groups, either as a lone operator or more likely as part of a team. You were dedicated and paid the price for your dedication. Such tools as yourself are eventually discarded, and loose ends are rarely left to dangle. Still, you honed your abilities, learned some valuable skills and an even more valuable lesson: never trust an employer.

## Data Liberator  
Almost any piece of information can be found on the Matrix, but the trick is knowing where to find it. Any information of serious value, however, is going to be hidden and protected. You spent your time learning all the ways that files can be secreted away, with the intention of learning how to root them out. Firewalls, IC, encryption, and data bombs became daily challenges, and more often than not you found your way around them. But to what end? What were you seeking to learn in your endless searches through the dark places of the Matrix? And what did you find at the end of your search?

* Contact Points: 2  
* Contact Types: Academic, Matrix, Street  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Data Havens, Espionage Techniques, Hacker Groups, or one level in any language skill  

## Demolitions Expert  
There are primarily two different kinds of people who learn to become demolitions experts: the ones who want to blow things up, and the ones who want to prevent things from blowing up. As it turns out, there’s actually a lot of overlap between those two kinds of people. You spent part of your life studying explosives, and got to set off quite a few pretty big ones.  
* Choose one: +1 to Agility, Reaction, or Logic  
* Choose one: +1 to Electronics, Engineering, or Stealth  
* Resources: +50,000 nuyen  
* Contact Points: 2  
* Contact Types: Criminal, Government  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Bomb Design, Structural Architecture, or one rank in any language skill  

## Detective  
You were employed by a law enforcement corporation to investigate crimes that threatened the profit margins of megacorporations.

# Drone Technician
Drones are ubiquitous in the sixth world, and people who can maintain, repair, upgrade, and even design them are always in demand. You learned a lot about how to operate and work on drones, but you also made a fair bit of nuyen. Those skills still come in handy.  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Agility, Logic, or Willpower  
* **Choose one:** +1 to Electronics, Engineering, or Piloting  
* **Resources:** +50,000 nuyen  
* **Contact Points:** 2  
* **Contact Types:** Corporate, Engineering, Matrix  
* **Knowledge skill (choose one):** Drone Models, Security Systems, Weapons Manufacturers, or one rank in any language skill

### EVENT: YOU STRUGGLED THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES  
Times were tough. Money was hard to come by, and everything just started going wrong all at once. You didn’t know what to do or who to turn to, and you had to struggle every step of the way. It was demoralizing and exhausting, and you hope never to have to live like that again. There were times that you believed you wouldn’t make it, and that life would never get any better. Somehow, you made it through.

### EVENT: YOUR HARD WORK PAID OFF  
So much time and effort spent working toward an end. It was hard work, and you made a lot of sacrifices.

Things were touch-and-go for a while there, but in the end it all worked out even better than you had anticipated.

## Event: You were overwhelmed, but things worked out

Circumstances forced you to stretch your mental faculties or social skills in order to find a way out of a looming problem. For so long you were overwhelmed, anxious, and exhausted, and there was no sign of a relief. You had to dig deep, get creative, and get yourself out of it. Somehow you managed, and you found that you had talents and capabilities you wouldn’t have believed if you hadn’t lived it.

## Event: You benefited from the influence of a mentor

Someone recognized your special talents and took the time to show you the ropes. It was nice having a mentor, someone who believed in you and helped you grow. Those were good times, and you learned so much. If your mentor is still alive, and if you are on good terms with them, they are one of your contacts. Otherwise, decide what you know about how they died, or why they no longer wish to associate with you.

## Event: You could have averted something bad that happened, if only you had the right skills or knowledge at the time

* +1 to four different skills  
* Knowledge skills: choose any two new knowledge or language skills  

You may acquire one negative quality that was caused by the trauma of this event.

## Event: You became extremely interested in unusual or mysterious topics

Whether due to your Awakened or Emerged status, or more mundane interests, you spent some time looking into the deeper mysteries. So many of them turned out to be false hopes and bad leads, and you learned a lot about things you never expected to learn.  
* +1 to three different skills  
* +1 to any attribute or special attribute  
* Knowledge skills (choose two): Arcana, Metaplanes, [Region/Era] History, or a level in any language skill  

## Event: You came into a large sum of money

* Resources: +100,000 nuyen  
* Contact Points: 4  

Acquire a negative quality that represents a complication caused by suddenly acquiring so much money, such as All Business (p. 135) or Distinctive Style.

## Event: You got away with a lucrative theft

You got a tip that something very valuable would be vulnerable to theft, and you took advantage of that tip. Perhaps this was your first crime, but even if it wasn’t, this represents an escalation in your criminal career. They say crime doesn’t pay, but you know that’s a lie.

## EVENT: YOU SURVIVED A LIFE-THREATENING EVENT, BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAPPENED TO HAVE JUST THE RIGHT PIECE OF GEAR

You learned the hard way that your life depends on your gear. Someone close to you didn’t survive to learn that lesson. Since then, you’ve been particularly careful to make sure you have well-maintained, high-quality equipment that you can depend on.  
* Resources: +75,000 nuyen  
* +1 to any skill  
* Contact Points: 4  

Acquire one positive or negative quality that is either the result of the traumatic loss you experienced or shows how you have grown since.

## LIFE PATH EXAMPLE

Let’s design a street samurai character using the life path system. Starting with the first childhood module, we’ll select troll for our metatype. Since trolls have a high maximum for Body and Strength, those attributes start at 2, but all the others (including Edge) start at 1. We’ll choose to be mundane, which pushes the Edge to 2. The nationality will be UCAS, and our native language will be English. The quality this character feels they were born with is Tough as Nails at level 2, which costs us 8 Karma. Moving on to early childhood, we have some skills to choose: We gain 2 ranks in Athletics, Close Combat, Perception, and Stealth. We’ll define the place we grew up as Seattle, and gain [Seattle] Area Knowledge. Maybe we grew up poor and on the streets, so we’ll take the Uneducated quality and gain 6 Karma. To finish off our childhood, we move on to the coming of age module. Our best skill as a street samurai will be Firearms, which we gain at rank 4. Our best attribute will be Agility. Since our maximum Agility is 5, we get to raise another attribute, our Reaction, by 1. For our defining quality, we choose Muscles, which costs us 6 Karma. We’ll mark down our starting amount of 25,000 nuyen, with the knowledge that we’re going to need a lot more. We assign 4 points to a single street-type contact, so Connection and Loyalty are each at 2.

Next, we must choose our eight adult life modules.  

**Module 1:** Ganger seems like a good start. We choose +1 Reaction, +1 Firearms, +1 Stealth, gain 25,000 nuyen, and upgrade our contact with a second type: criminal. Connection and Loyalty each go up to 3. We gain the [Seattle] Gangs knowledge skill.  

**Module 2:** Organized Crime. You moved up in the criminal world, picking up some odd jobs for the Mafia. We choose +1 Body, +1 Firearms, +1 Athletics, and +1 Edge. We upgrade our criminal street contact’s ratings each to 4 and learn the [Seattle] Underworld knowledge skill.  

**Module 3:** Mentor. You looked out for the younger gangers and helped them learn how to survive. Some of them actually did. We choose +1 Intuition, +1 Reaction, +1 Close Combat, and add 25,000 nuyen to our total. Our 4 new contact points go to a new medical-type contact with Connection and Loyalty ratings of 2 each.  

**Module 4:** The theft event. We gain 75,000 nuyen, +1 to Reaction, and 4 contact points that we use to upgrade our medical contact to rating 4 Connection and Loyalty. We take the Bounty quality and gain 10 Karma.  

**Module 5:** Guide. +1 Intuition, +1 Athletics, +1 Stealth, +25,000 nuyen. We add the street type to our medical contact and raise their ratings each to 5, and decide that they’re our Street Doc.  

**Module 6:** Ganger. We can only take one module twice, and this one is a good fit. +1 Body, +1 Close Combat, +1 Stealth, +25,000 nuyen. Our Mafia Don contact (criminal and street type) goes up to Connection and Loyalty 5, and we learn the knowledge skill [Seattle] Streets.  

**Module 7:** Event: we pushed our body to its limits, perhaps representing the strain of receiving multiple augmentations. +2 Body, +1 Intuition, +1 Edge. Our street doc is upgraded to Connection and Loyalty 7. We choose the High Pain Tolerance quality at a cost of 7 Karma.  

**Module 8:** Military. Our Mafia contacts got you work with a mercenary company. +1 Body, +1 Strength, +1 Close Combat, +25,000 nuyen, and a new corporate contact with Connection and Loyalty 1. The Small Unit Tactics knowledge skill is also bound to come in handy.  

Our final attributes are Body 7, Agility 5, Reaction 5, Strength 3, Willpower 1, Logic 1, Intuition 4, Charisma 1, Edge 4. Our skills are Athletics 4, Close Combat 5, Firearms 6, Perception 2, Stealth 5. Our knowledge skills are [Seattle] Area Knowledge, [Seattle] Gangs, [Seattle] Streets, [Seattle] Underworld, and Small Unit Tactics.  

For contacts we have a Mafia Don with Connection and Loyalty 5, a Street Doc with Connection and Loyalty 7, and a Corporate Secretary with Connection and Loyalty 1.  

Our qualities are Bounty, Built Tough, High Pain Tolerance, Muscles, Tough as Nails, and Uneducated, which leaves us with 45 customization Karma. 25 of that goes to raise our Willpower to 3, and the remaining 20 brings our Strength to 4.  

Most of our 225,000 nuyen is going to pay for a lot of cyberware, and the rest we’ll use to buy weapons, armor, and other gear. We’ll leave those specifics to your imagination, or feel free to complete the character to play yourself if it’s what you’re looking for.

# SUIT UP

Pre-assembled character kits (PACKs) are collections of gear that have been gathered for you in order to save you time and help you select the right gear for your character. They’re great for new players who might not realize what accessories are needed, and you don’t have to worry about getting to buy ammo for your guns! They can also save time for veteran players. Some of the PACKs are designed for everything a character needs, and others are more specific.

## Shadowrunner Starter PACK  
*(25,000 nuyen)*

No matter what your skillset might be, these are the essential items that if you don’t buy, you will wish you had. No weapons, armor, vehicles, or sensory gear are included. What this does set you up with is a fairly solid fake ID, a month of Low lifestyle, a decent commlink and a burner, and a variety of equipment that will certainly come in handy sooner rather than later. Ideally, every shadowrunner has the items in this PACK.

**Gear:**  
Fake SIN (rating 4), two fake licenses (rating 4, specify license), Hermes Ikon commlink, Meta Link commlink, stealth tags (10), bug scanner, tag eraser, area jammer (rating 6), micro-transceiver, plastic straps (10), miniwelder, two spare miniwelder fuel canisters, gas mask, respirator (rating 6), climbing gear, survival kit, flashlight (choose standard or low-light), gecko tape gloves, grapple gun (w/ 100m rope), biomonitor, 2 stim patches (rating 6), 2 trauma patches, 1 month low lifestyle (or 2,000 nuyen toward another lifestyle), trid projector, mapsoft (local area)

## Complete Character PACKs

So you want to make a shadowrunner, but either don’t know what you need to buy to make things work, or just don’t want to take the time chasing all

of your gear down. Complete character PACKs are designed to spend every last nuyen and make sure you have everything you need for a particular type of character. The nuyen costs for these packs are equal to the specific amounts at the different resources priorities, so if you use the point-buy or life path system it won’t line up exactly. Just make sure you have enough nuyen, and you’ll probably have a little extra. Or you could choose a complete character PACK at a lower nuyen cost than you have available, and still have some money to spend for more gear.

# Dirt Poor  
_(8,000 nuyen)_  
If you put resources at minimum and don’t want to spend any of your starting Karma on extra nuyen, you only start with 8,000 nuyen using the priority system. Generally speaking, this is the least amount of money that a *Shadowrun* character can start with. You can’t afford any expensive specialized gear, or even a worthwhile fake SIN (which should probably be one of the first things you purchase when you come into some money). So this PACK includes what you’ll need and can actually afford. Note that this is the only complete character PACK that does not also include the shadowrunner starter PACK.  
Because you’re too broke.

**Weapons:** Defiance Super-Shock Taser (w/ hidden arm slide, 10 taser darts), shock gloves  
**Armor:** Armor vest (w/ chemical protection 1, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 2)  
**Other Gear:** Contacts (rating 3 w/ flare compensation, image link, choose either low-light or thermographic vision), micro-transceiver, Sony Emperor commlink  
**Lifestyle:** One month Low lifestyle

# Full Magician  
_(50,000 nuyen)_  
Most magicians have little need of expensive technology or augmentations in order to do their work. Some equipment is helpful, however, and a magical lodge with a healthy supply of reagents is essential. This PACK includes all the gear that you need to start with. If you find yourself with extra nuyen, consider purchasing a focus as your next expenditure.

**Recommended Skills:** Conjuring, Enchanting, Sorcery, Athletics  
**Included PACK:** Shadowrunner Starter PACK  
**Weapons:** 4 throwing knives, 2 stun grenades, 2 fragmentation grenades, 2 thermal smoke grenades  
**Armor:** Armor jacket (w/ chemical protection 2, cold resistance 2, electricity resistance 2, and fire resistance 2), helmet  
**Other Gear:** Magical lodge materials (Force 6), 100 reagents, 10 stim patches (rating 6), mage-sight goggles, periscope, optical binoculars, contacts (w/ image link, flare compensation, choose either low-light or thermographic vision)  
**Vehicle:** Chrysler-Nissan Jackrabbit (w/ rating 2 maneuvering autosoft)  
**Fake Licenses (rating 4, from the starter PACK):** Magician, Stun Grenades (license also covers the Flash-pak)  
**Lifestyle (upgraded from the starter PACK):** One month Medium lifestyle

# Close Combat Adept  
_(50,000 nuyen)_  
Adepts are most known for their prowess as martial artists, and you aren’t an exception to this. Adept powers are incredibly effective for close combat specialists, and that’s what you do best. You don’t need to rely on expensive gear and augmentations but having a weapon focus certainly helps to make you an even more effective warrior.

**Recommended Skills:** Close Combat, Athletics  
**Included PACK:** Shadowrunner Starter PACK  
**Weapon Focus:** Choose one Close Combat weapon you own. This weapon is enchanted as a weapon focus (Force 3). You must pay 9 Karma if you wish to bond the focus, which will unlock its effect.  
**Weapons:** Combat axe, katana, polearm, telescoping staff, combat knife, 4 throwing knives  
**Armor:** Armor vest (w/ chemical protection 1, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 2), helmet  
**Fake Licenses (rating 4, from the starter PACK):** Magician, Foci  
**Lifestyle (from the starter PACK):** One month Low lifestyle

# Face  
_(50,000 nuyen)_  
You’ve always been good with words, and over the years you have learned to use your social talents much like a magician uses spells or a hacker bypasses firewalls. Most of what you do is based on your own attributes and skills, but the right clothes and a few odds and ends help you get the job done.

**Recommended Skills:** Con, Stealth, Influence  
**Included PACK:** Shadowrunner Starter PACK

**SUIT UP // COMPLETE CHARACTER PACKS**

# GUNSLINGER ADEPT  
_(50,000 nuyen)_

Not all adepts focus on close combat. If you’re building an adept that uses guns, this **PACK** includes all the gear you need with none of those Magic-reducing augmentations. That said, if you’re building any gun-focused character and either don’t want augmentations or would rather choose them yourself, this **PACK** is also a great starting point. Most of this **PACK** consists of a wide variety of guns, each with its special purpose. The Warhawk is the open-carry, don’t-frag-with-me lethal sidearm, while the Predator packs gel rounds for a non-lethal option. The Redhawk and Ares Light Fire in hidden arm slides provide the same roles with a bit less firepower, but with the benefit of concealability and a quick way to get some Edge in a fight. The Mossberg is an all-purpose assault weapon, and the Crockett EBR is the perfect tool for suppressed sniping. This **PACK** assumes you won’t be getting a smartlink installed in your eyes, but if you do, you should take the smartlink out of the contacts and spend that 2,000 nuyen elsewhere. More ammo is always nice.

----

**Weapons:** Shock gloves, light collapsible crossbow (w/ concealable holster, 5 Narcoject injection bolts), 2 stun grenades, 2 fragmentation grenades, 2 thermal smoke grenades, Flash-pak

# Cybered Covert Operative  
_(150,000 nuyen)_  

You’ve got the skills, augmentations, and special equipment to infiltrate any facility, and the combat abilities to fight your way out when things go wrong. Your cyberlimb appears to be completely natural but is equipped with two powerful weapons: one lethal, one non-lethal.

**Essence Cost:** 3.4  
**Recommended Skills:** Cracking, Electronics, Stealth, Piloting  
**Included PACK:** Shadowrunner Starter PACK  
**Augmentations:** cyberjack (rating 6, used), datajack

bits, like your internal organs and brain, almost your entire body has been replaced. Don’t bother investing much into your natural Agility and Strength, because your cyberlimbs have that covered. Body and Reaction, however, are still very important for you.

You’ll always attract stares, and likely never live anything resembling a normal life. You look more like an armored anthrodrone than a metahuman. But that’s okay with you, because the capabilities you have gained are impressive.

# WEAPONS SPECIALIST  
_(275,000 nuyen)_  

The weapons specialist is perhaps more accurately described as a weapons generalist. That’s because you specialize in being able to wield every kind of weapon. You never know what tool you’re going to need, so why not have access to all of them? This PACK includes the augmentations you’ll need to make the most of your arsenal, but the real meat here is a huge collection and variety of weapons.

# TRANSPORT RIGGER  
_(450,000 nuyen)_

Sometimes riggers are about the simple task of moving things from one place to another. This isn’t as simple as it sounds, since some of those things are shadowrunners, and when shadowrunners move, others often try to stop them. So this contains the augmentations and gear a rigger needs to be good at their job, as well as some armor and a sidearm to keep trouble at bay. It has two fully outfitted vehicles and some drones to act primarily in an escort role.

# DRONE RIGGER  
_(450,000 nuyen)_

This rigger PACK has one vehicle to get the character around and a squad of heavily armed drones to cause chaos wherever they go. Since drones with guns often tend to get banged up, the PACK also includes kits and shops to keep them in working order, along with all the basic rigger needs.

# AUGMENTED FOR FIREARMS PACK

_(25,000 nuyen)_

Unlike the complete character PACKs, this PACK is a useful starting point for mundane characters or even gunslinger adepts who are willing to sacrifice a little Essence. The cybereyes are smartlink-ready, with built-in magnification that is useful for spotting and hitting targets at longer ranges. The reflex recorder provides you with an extra die on all Firearms tests. Every gun-toting shadowrunner needs a sidearm and some concealable backup weapons. The Ares Predator is kitted out for stealth, but you can slot explosive rounds when things go loud. The other pistols are solid backup weapons that you might be able to sneak past security. But if you’re going for a heavier combat character, it would be a good idea to pick up some individual gun PACKs to go with this. Your augmentations will work just as well for big guns as they do for your sidearms. Also, don’t forget to buy some armor.

**Essence Cost:** 0.41

**Recommended Skills:** Firearms

**Augmentations:** Cybereyes (rating 3, w/ flare compensation, low-light vision, vision magnification, smartlink), reflex recorder (Firearms, used)

**Weapons:** Ares Predator VI (w/ quickdraw holster, silencer, 5 variable ammunition clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds, 100 explosive rounds), Ares Light Fire 75 (w/ hidden arm slide, 4 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds), Streetline Special (w/ concealed holster, external smartgun system, 2 spare clips, 20 explosive rounds)

# WEAPONS PACKS

Sure you can just pick individual weapons off the shelf, but to be effective you’ll at least need some ammunition and a few accessories or modifications. These weapon PACKs include everything you need for a weapon in one place, all tallied up for you. Many of these weapons already come with built-in options, and those are usually not mentioned here, so make sure you take the time to read over the weapon’s published text.

## CROSSBOWS

Crossbows are especially effective when equipped with injection bolts. They’re also quite silent. Also, the Athletics skill is used to fire them, which makes them a perfect backup weapon for a character with no other combat skills.

* **Light crossbow** (w/ internal smartgun system, top-mounted laser sight, 10 Narcoject injection bolts): **1,175 nuyen**

* **Standard crossbow** (w/ top-mounted smartgun system with vision magnification, under-mounted laser sight, 20 bolts, 10 Narcoject injection bolts): **2,015 nuyen**

* **Heavy crossbow** (w/ top-mounted smartgun system with vision magnification, under-mounted laser sight, 20 bolts, 10 Narcoject injection bolts): **2,150 nuyen**

## TASERS

Most runners don’t look twice at tasers, but having a concealed weapon that most guards won’t look twice at comes in handy.

* **Defiance Super-Shock Taser** (w/ hidden arm slide, 10 taser darts): **700 nuyen**

* **Yamaha Pulsar II** (w/ hidden arm slide, 10 taser darts): **710 nuyen**

## HOLD-OUT PISTOLS

These are some of the most concealable weapons you can buy, but they don’t have a lot of firepower. Think of them as a backup weapon or a tool for when concealability is paramount.

* **Fichetti Tiffani Needler** (w/ internal smartgun system, concealable holster, 5 spare clips, 20 caseless flechette rounds): **1,335 nuyen**

* **Streetline Special** (w/ internal smartgun system, concealable holster, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds): **975 nuyen**

* **Walther Palm Pistol** (w/ internal smartgun system, concealable holster, 100 explosive rounds): **1,095 nuyen**

## LIGHT PISTOLS

Light pistols can be almost as dangerous as their heavier cousins, but you can’t fit a heavy pistol in a hidden arm slide! They sacrifice a small amount of firepower in exchange for being concealable and are


---


much more viable in a firefight than a hold-out pistol. And while having a weapon at the ready is an obvious advantage of the hidden arm slide, don’t overlook that you gain an Edge just for using them to arm yourself. The Ares Light Fire is a silenced weapon, the Beretta gives you a full-auto firing mode, and the Ruger Redhawk is a powerful revolver for its size.

**Ares Light Fire 75** (w/ specialized silencer, hidden arm slide, 5 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,700 nuyen**

**Beretta 201T** (w/ external smartgun system, gas vent system, hidden arm slide, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,250 nuyen**

**Ruger Redhawk** (w/ internal smartgun system, top-mounted laser sight, hidden arm slide, 5 speed loaders, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,675 nuyen**

## Machine Pistols

The Ares Crusader is an incredible deal, with integrated smartgun and gas-vent systems for a very low price. Two variants of the Ceska Black Scorpion are presented here; the difference between these two PACKs based on the same machine pistol is the smartgun system versus a laser sight. Most runners tend to prefer smartlinks, but a laser sight is a lot harder for enemy hackers to mess with and requires no extra gear to utilize. The Steyr TMP’s claim to fame is a full-auto firing mode. All come with concealable holsters.

**Ares Crusader II** (w/ concealable holster, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **770 nuyen**

**Ceska Black Scorpion** (w/ internal smartgun system, concealable holster, gas-vent system, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,860 nuyen**

**Ceska Black Scorpion** (w/ top-mounted laser sight, concealable holster, gas vent system, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,485 nuyen**

**Steyr TMP** (w/ suppressor, concealable holster, 5 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,540 nuyen**

## Heavy Pistols

These PACKs include several variations of accessories and modifications for some of the most popular pistols on the market. Some take full advantage of modern technological upgrades, while others are modified as throwbacks so that it becomes impossible to hack them, with the drawback of no smartlink.

**Ares Predator VI** (w/ quickdraw holster, gas-vent system, 5 spare variable ammunition clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,850 nuyen**

**Ares Predator VI** (w/ concealable holster, silencer, 5 spare variable ammunition clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,750 nuyen**

**Ares Viper Slivergun** (w/ internal smartgun system, top-mounted laser sight, concealable holster, 5 spare clips, 150 flechette rounds): **1,675 nuyen**

**Colt Manhunter** (throwback, quickdraw holster, gas-vent system, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,325 nuyen**

**Colt Manhunter** (throwback, w/ concealable holster, silencer, 5 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,200 nuyen**

**Ruger Super Warhawk** (w/ external smartgun system with vision magnification, quickdraw holster, 5 speed loaders, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **2,050 nuyen**

**Ruger Super Warhawk** (throwback, w/ top-mounted laser sight, quickdraw holster, 4 speed loaders, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,150 nuyen**

## Shotguns

Shotguns are powerful and generally inexpensive assault weapons with high attack ratings and lots of range. With the exception of the short-barrel Defiance T-250 and Remington Roomsweeper, concealing them is not an option. And all of them are going to be loud.

**Short-Barrel Defiance T-250** (short-barrel modification, throwback, w/ top-mounted laser sight, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,175 nuyen**

**Short-Barrel Defiance T-250** (short-barrel modification, w/ external smartgun system, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,250 nuyen**

**Mossberg CMDT** (throwback, 4 spare drums, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,470 nuyen**

**Mossberg CMDT** (w/ internal smartgun system, 4 spare drums, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,970 nuyen**

**Remington Roomsweeper** (w/ external smartgun system, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **875 nuyen**

## Submachine Guns

The Praetor and Ingram Smartgun are ideal if you need a smartlink-ready SMG, but the Colt Cobra and UZI IV here have been modified so that they cannot interface with the Matrix (and therefore cannot be hacked). If you need a suppressed option with a laser sight instead of a smartgun system, go with the HK-227. Note that both the HK-227 and Ingram Smartgun come standard with suppressors, and the Ingram also packs in a gas vent system for recoil compensation.

**Colt Cobra TZ-120** (throwback, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,215 nuyen**

**FN P93 Praetor** (w/ external smartgun system with vision

magnification, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **2,000 nuyen**

**HK-227** (w/ top-mounted laser sight, 5 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,225 nuyen**

**Ingram Smartgun XI** (w/ 5 spare clips, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds): **1,025 nuyen**

**Uzi IV** (throwback, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **730 nuyen**

## RIFLES

These are the workhorses of the combat-heavy kits. The AK-97 and FN-HAR are ideal for their firepower, while the Ares Alpha and Yamaha Raiden come stock with grenade launchers and other goodies. The Ares Desert Strike and Crockett EBR are some of the most effective metahuman-portable firearms you can buy. The reason the Crockett has both a laser sight and a smartgun system is because you’ll usually want the advantage of the smartlink, but when stealth is critical, it’s useful to turn off your wireless devices to avoid detection. It never hurts to have a backup.

**AK-97** (w/ internal smartgun system w/ vision magnification, top-mounted laser sight, gas vent system, shock pad, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **4,500 nuyen**

**Ares Alpha** (w/ top-mounted laser sight, gas-vent system, shock pad, 5 spare rifle clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds, 5 spare grenade launcher clips, 6 stun grenades, 6 fragmentation grenades, 6 high explosive grenades, 6 smoke grenades, 6 thermal smoke grenades): **7,825 nuyen**

**FN-HAR** (w/ external smartgun system, shock pad, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **3,075 nuyen**

**FN-HAR** (throwback, w/ shock pad, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **2,875 nuyen**

**Yamaha Raiden** (w/ shock pad, 5 spare rifle clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds, 5 spare grenade launcher clips, 4 stun grenades, 4 fragmentation grenades, 4 high explosive grenades, 4 smoke grenades, 4 thermal smoke grenades): **6,000 nuyen**

**Ares Desert Strike** (w/ gas vent system, 5 spare clips, 100 APDS rounds, 100 Stick-n-Shock rounds): **12,525 nuyen**

**Ares Desert Strike** (w/ suppressor, 5 spare clips, 100 APDS rounds, 100 stick-n-shock rounds): **12,525 nuyen**

**Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR** (w/ internal smartgun system, underbarrel laser sight, gas-vent system, 5 spare clips, 100 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds): **10,900 nuyen**

## MACHINE GUNS

There’s not much to say about these big guns. A bit more ammo is included in these PACKs due to the rapid pace that you’re likely to burn through it. With the exception of the Panther cannon, of course, which uses assault cannon rounds.

**Ingram Valiant** (w/ external smartgun system, 5 spare clips, 200 explosive rounds, 200 gel rounds): **5,800 nuyen**

**Stoner-Ares M202** (w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, top-mounted laser sight, gas-vent system, shock pad, 5 spare clips, 200 explosive rounds, 200 gel rounds): **10,000 nuyen**

**RPK HMG** (w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, top-mounted laser sight, gas-vent system, shock pad, 5 spare clips, 200 explosive rounds, 200 gel rounds): **11,100 nuyen**

**Panther XXL** (w/ top-mounted laser sight, shock pad, 5 spare clips, 100 assault cannon rounds): **10,700 nuyen**

## LAUNCHERS

Grenades and rockets are useful as area-effect weapons and distractions, but if you can manage to catch your target within the ground zero, the damage output is extreme. Just don’t even think about using them on a stealth op—except maybe as a distraction. No missiles are included among these, just rockets, due to the incredible added cost for minimal benefit. Keep in mind that ammunition for these weapons is expensive: 150 nuyen for most grenades, and over 2,000 nuyen per rocket. Make your shots count!

**ArmTech MGL-6** (w/ airburst link, external smartgun system with vision magnification, 5 spare clips, 6 stun grenades, 6 fragmentation grenades, 6 high explosive grenades, 6 smoke grenades, 6 thermal smoke grenades): **6,125 nuyen**

**ArmTech MGL-12** (w/ airburst link, external smartgun system with vision magnification, 5 spare clips, 12 stun grenades, 12 fragmentation grenades, 12 high explosive grenades, 12 smoke grenades, 12 thermal smoke grenades): **12,325 nuyen**

**Aztechnology Striker** (throwback, 2 fragmentation rockets, 2 high explosive rockets): **15,200 nuyen**

**Onotari Interceptor** (w/ vision magnification, airburst link, 2 fragmentation rockets, 2 high explosive rockets): **18,300 nuyen**

## ARMOR PACKS

No shadowrunner leaves home without their armor, and only gutter punks and wageslaves wear armor that hasn’t been upgraded with additional protection against being frozen, zapped, or burned. These PACKs include the protective upgrades you’re going to want.

**Actioneer Business Clothes** (w/ chemical protection 2, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 1, fire resistance 2): **3,000 nuyen**


---


**Armor Jacket** (w/ chemical protection 2, cold resistance 2, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 2): **3,200 nuyen**

**Armor Vest** (w/ chemical protection 1, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 2): **2,250 nuyen**

**Full Body Armor** (w/ helmet, chemical seal, chemical protection 1, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 1, fire resistance 1), fake license (rating 4, full body armor): **7,300 nuyen**

**Lined Coat** (w/ chemical protection 1, cold resistance 2, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 2): **2,650 nuyen**

**Urban Explorer Jumpsuit** (w/ chemical protection 2, cold resistance 1, electricity resistance 2, fire resistance 1): **2,300 nuyen**

**Smartlinked Helmet** (w/ flare compensation, image link, smartlink): **2,475 nuyen**

**Augmented Vision Helmet** (w/ flare compensation, image link, low-light vision, thermographic vision): **1,975 nuyen**

**Enhanced Vision Helmet** (w/ flare compensation, vision enhancement, vision magnification): **1,200 nuyen**

### SENSOR PACKS

Unless your senses are naturally, magically, or cybernetically enhanced, it’s a good idea to pick up something that lets you see in the dark and around corners, use smartgun-ready weapons, see and hear with incredible sensitivity, or detect things you don’t otherwise have senses for.

### IDENTITY PACKS

Operating without a SIN can be very difficult in some places. Every runner needs at least one decent fake ID, and most own several. Yeah, they’re expensive and can easily get burned, but the benefit of being able to blend in with the SINners is almost always worth the expense and risk.

* **Cheap Fake ID:** fake SIN (rating 2), 2 fake licenses (rating 2, specify): **5,800 nuyen**

* **Risky Fake ID:** fake SIN (rating 3), 2 fake licenses (rating 3, specify): **8,700 nuyen**

Cyberjack (rating 6, used), headware cyberdeck (Renraku Kitsune), datajack

Cyberprogram Everything PACK

## HACKER PACK C  
*(184,170 nuyen)*

PACK C is a bargain, providing admirable hardware for far less nuyen than many hackers feel the need to invest. If you’re making a more well-rounded hacker character, or a character that doubles up in more than one skillset, this PACK is a great option. This PACK is the lowest tier recommended for a serious hacker.

**Essence Cost:** 3.36

Cyberjack (rating 5, used), headware cyberdeck (Renraku Kistune), datajack

Cyberprogram Everything PACK

## HACKER PACK D  
*(162,670 nuyen)*

PACK D is for when you’re really tight on Essence and nuyen, but you want to make sure that you have what you need for a hacker. You’re much better off if you can afford PACK C instead, which does not cost much more nuyen and Essence, but if you can’t, this PACK will get you by.

**Essence Cost:** 3.03

Cyberjack (rating 4, used), headware cyberdeck (Renraku Kitsune), datajack

Cyberprogram Everything PACK

## HACKER PACK E  
*(129,170 nuyen)*

PACK E might get you by, and it’s one of the most inexpensive kits for a hacker to start out with. It’s also a good option if hacking is a secondary skillset for you.

**Essence Cost:** 3.06

Cyberjack (rating 4, used), headware cyberdeck (Spinrad Falcon), datajack

Cyberprogram Everything PACK

## HACKER PACK F  
*(64,870 nuyen)*

Okay, this technically enables you to hack, but don’t try anything too fancy with it. This PACK is about the cheapest you can go and still have a reasonable shot at hacking. If you’ve got the skills to back it up, you just might be able to make it work. Even so, you’re probably going to want to upgrade this sooner rather than later.

**Essence Cost:** 2.8

Cyberjack (rating 3, used), headware cyberdeck (Erika MCD-6), datajack

Cyberprograms: Baby Monitor, Signal Scrub

Alternate grade costs: used 5,500 nuyen/0.22 Essence, alpha 13,200 nuyen/0.16 Essence, beta 16,500 nuyen/0.14 Essence

# Skill Rig PACK A  
**(270,000 nuyen)**  
Yes, this ’ware is expensive as can be, and it’s going to cost you 30,000 more nuyen for every additional active skill that takes full advantage of its capabilities, but if you want to have the best cybernetic skillwire system possible, settle for nothing less. You can run up to two rating 6 activesofts at once, but this PACK only starts you out with one. You are capable of running knowsofts and linguasofts along with activesofts. Sold separately.

# All in the Reflexes  
**(180,000 nuyen)**  
This wired reflexes and reaction enhancers PACK is standard for street samurai and elite corporate security alike. It brings you to your augmented maximum for Reaction, which greatly improves your defense pools and initiative, but it also provides you with a total of four Minor Actions, which you may swap out for a second Major Action. You now have the option of whether to make multiple attacks, or save your extra Minor Actions for things like moving, taking cover, dodging, and blocking.

**Essence Cost:** 2.6  
Wired reflexes (rating 2), reaction enhancers (rating 2)

Alternate grade costs: used 90,000 nuyen/2.86 Essence, alpha 216,000 nuyen/2.08 Essence, beta 270,000 nuyen/1.82 Essence

This cyberskull serves one purpose, which is to provide your head with subtle protection. It provides a bonus of +2 to your Defense rating and an extra box to your Physical condition monitor, and it looks completely natural.

**Thick Skull**  
*(25,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 0.75  
Cyberskull (synthetic, w/ armor 2)  
Alternate grade costs: used 12,500 nuyen/0.825 Essence, alpha 30,000 nuyen/0.6 Essence

For not much more nuyen, you can have even more armor on your head. Most people aren’t willing to go with an obvious cyberskull, though.

**Chrome Dome**  
*(30,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 0.75  
Cyberskull (obvious, w/ armor 4)  
Alternate grade costs: used 15,000 nuyen/0.825 Essence, alpha 36,000 nuyen/0.6 Essence

----

This PACK is a favorite with discreet couriers and smugglers, but any shadowrunner might find it handy to have a smuggling compartment in their torso. Adding an extra box to your Physical condition monitor is a nice bonus. If you just want a hiding spot for small objects, a bioware skin pocket might be a more economical choice. You can carry a lot more in a torso compartment than a skin pocket, though!

**Stealth Torso**  
*(31,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 1.5  
Cybertorso (synthetic, w/ smuggling compartment)  
Alternate grade costs: used 16,500 nuyen/1.65 Essence, alpha 37,200 nuyen/1.2 Essence, beta 46,500 nuyen/1.05 Essence

*(50,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 1.5  
Cybertorso (synthetic, w/ armor 5)  
Alternate grade costs: used 25,000 nuyen/1.65 Essence, alpha 60,000 nuyen/1.2 Essence, beta 75,000 nuyen/1.05 Essence

----

This cybertorso PACK makes it obvious that you have an armored torso, but it also includes a smuggling compartment.

**Cyborg Torso**  
*(51,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 1.5  
Cybertorso (obvious, w/ armor 5, smuggling compartment)

----

This PACK is for those who want a cyberarm with excellent attributes and a natural appearance. Even if you aren’t very agile or strong, this arm can make up for it. Or if you’re already a badass, it can keep up with the rest of you.

**Cyberarm: Excellence**  
*(60,000 nuyen)*

**Essence Cost:** 1  
Cyberarm (synthetic, w/ Agility 6, Strength 6)

# CYBERARM: ASSASSIN

Alternate grade costs: used 25,000 nuyen/1.1 Essence, alpha 60,000 nuyen/0.8 Essence, beta 75,000 nuyen/0.7 Essence  

----

# CYBERARM: FIREARM  
_(52,650 Nuyen)_  
While it might be obvious that your arm is a cybernetic replacement, what isn’t obvious is that you have a gun installed in it. Well, except for when you’re shooting someone, or slot a clip into your arm. Then it’s pretty obvious.

**Essence Cost:** 1  
Cyberarm (obvious, w/ Agility 6, Strength 4, cyber implant Ares Predator VI, external clip port, silencer), 5 spare variable ammunition clips, 100 caseless regular rounds, 100 caseless gel rounds  

Alternate grade costs: used 26,325 nuyen/1.1 Essence, alpha 63,060 nuyen/0.8 Essence, beta 78,675 nuyen/0.7 Essence  

----

# CYBERARM: HEAVILY ARMED  
_(56,000 Nuyen)_  
This cyberarm PACK is for anyone who prefers to throw as much lead at their enemies as quickly as possible. It’s got the Strength enhancement to allow you to handle heavier weapons and the Agility to make sure you can fire them accurately, but the real draw here is a gyromount system that negates all recoil penalties. Rock and roll!

**Essence Cost:** 1  
Cyberarm (obvious, w/ Agility 6, Strength 5, gyromount)  

Alternate grade costs: used 28,000 nuyen/1.1 Essence, alpha 67,200 nuyen/0.8 Essence

----

# SPRINGHEEL JACK  
_(120,000 Nuyen)_  
These cyberlegs are obvious, sure, but they are also obviously awesome! You can run fast, kick hard, and jump far, and get two more boxes on your Physical condition monitor. What more could you want?

**Essence Cost:** 2  
Augmentations: two cyberlegs (obvious, Agility 6, Strength 6, hydraulic jacks rating 6)  

Alternate grade costs: used 60,000 nuyen/2.2 Essence, alpha 144,000 nuyen/1.6 Essence, beta 180,000 nuyen/1.4 Essence

_(180,000 Nuyen)_

# BIKES

## ARMED HARLEY-DAVIDSON SCORPION PACK

This chopper mounts a huge cannon on the front. Go big or go home!

**Harley-Davidson Scorpion** (w/ rigger adaptation, front-facing heavy weapon mount: Panther XXL w/ 100 assault cannon rounds)  

## ARMED YAMAHA GROWLER PACK  
_(17,050 Nuyen)_  
This off-road trike is equipped with a sup-

pressed heavy machinegun. Even with a suppressor, the RPK is going to make some noise.

Yamaha Growler (w/ rigger adaptation, front-facing heavy weapon mount: RPK HMG w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, suppressor, 200 explosive rounds, 200 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds)

## Armed Suzuki Mirage  
(26,308 nuyen)  
This super-fast motorcycle is also armed to the teeth with an assault rifle/grenade launcher/shotgun combo.

Suzuki Mirage (w/ rigger adaptation, front-facing standard weapon mount: Yamaha Raiden w/ airburst link, 150 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds, 4 high explosive grenades, 2 explosive shotgun rounds)

Note: The Yamaha Raiden is a silenced assault rifle with an underbarrel shotgun/grenade launcher. The weapon mount’s ammunition bin can feed rounds to the assault rifle, but the underbarrel weapons must be reloaded by hand.

## Cars

### Armed Hyundai Shin-Hyung PACK  
(32,400 nuyen)  
The Hyundai Shin-Hyung is inexpensive, fast, and has excellent on-road handling. The drawback is that its light frame is not resistant to damage. So don’t get shot.

Hyundai Shin-Hyung (w/ rigger adaptation, 2 standard weapon mounts: one front, one rear, each mount is armed with an AK-97 w/ external smartgun system, gas vent system, 150 explosive rounds, and 100 gel rounds)

### Armed Ford Americar PACK  
(38,750 nuyen)  
The Ford Americar is a ubiquitous sedan, making it a useful tool for when you want to blend in. So why not install a nasty surprise, like a Panther cannon mounted in the trunk? The hardest part of owning one is resisting the temptation to use it on every fragger who rides your bumper in traffic.

Ford Americar (w/ rigger adaptation, rear-facing heavy weapon mount: Panther XXL w/ 100 assault cannon rounds, front-facing standard weapon mount: FN HAR w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, 150 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds)

CARS // SUIT UP


---


# Armed Eurocar  
## Westwind X80 Pack  
_(145,200 nuyen)_  

This pack is fragging expensive, but it’s also the most badass sports car on the market, made deadly by installing a rocket launcher mount. Ammunition reloads are very expensive, so make sure the target is worth spending one on. That said, this car is designed for speed, not combat durability. Blowing something up before it can shoot at you might be vitally important. This thing also comes with a reasonably competent pilot, so it’s not too bad at driving itself.

**Eurocar Westind X80** (w/ rigger adaptation, rear-facing heavy weapon mount: Onotari Interceptor launcher w/ airburst link, 6 High Explosive Rockets, rating 4 autosofts: maneuvering, clearsight, stealth, [Onotari Interceptor] targeting)  

> Note: The Pilot can only run two autosofts simultaneously. You may reconfigure which autosofts are loaded with a Minor Action.

----

# Trucks and Vans  
## Armed GMC Bulldog Pack  
_(52,000 nuyen)_  

The Bulldog step van is as common as the Ford Americar. It’s also big, tough, and comes stock with a lot of armor. It’s not very fast, and doesn’t handle sudden maneuvers very well, on or off-road. This one has a pop-up turret with a big-ass machine gun. Perfect for hauling a team of runners around, and capable of taking as well as dishing out plenty of damage, and it’s relatively inexpensive.

**GMC Bulldog** (w/ rigger adaptation, pop-up turret heavy weapon mount: RPK HMG w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, gas-vent system, 250 explosive rounds, 250 gel rounds)

----

## Armed Range Rover Model 2080 Pack  
_(127,650 nuyen)_  

The natural upgrade from the Bulldog van is the Range Rover Model 2080. This more expensive vehicle is tough, but also has the style and grace the Bulldog lacks. Better in almost every way—except for the price tag, of course. One of its benefits is a fairly competent pilot rating, allowing it to drive itself when needed. This PACK is armed to the teeth, with three weapon mounts: a rocket launcher, Panther cannon, and assault rifle.

**Range Rover Model 2080** (w/ rigger adaptation, pop-up heavy weapon mount: Onotari Interceptor launcher w/ airburst link, 8 high explosive rockets, rear-facing heavy weapon mount: Panther XXL w/ 100 assault cannon rounds, front-facing standard weapon mount: FN HAR w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, 150 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds, rating 4 autosofts: clearsight, maneuvering, stealth, [Onotari Interceptor] targeting, [Panther XXL] targeting, [FN HAR] targeting)  

> Note: The Pilot can only run two autosofts simultaneously. You may reconfigure which autosofts are loaded with a Minor Action.

----

# Armed Ares  
## Roadmaster Pack  
_(84,000 nuyen)_  

A huge, heavily armored cargo truck, armed with the biggest machine gun on the market. Just don’t expect to outrun much else. But hey, that’s what the armor and weapon mount are for!

**Ares Roadmaster** (w/ rigger adaptation, pop-up heavy weapon mount: RPK HMG w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, gas-vent system, 250 explosive rounds, 250 gel rounds)

----

# Boats  
## Armed Samuvani  
### Criscraft Otter Pack  
_(39,200 nuyen)_  

This small motorboat is perfect for quick runs on the open water, whether that be an ocean, lake, river, or canal. If you run into trouble, you probably won’t be able to stand up to any serious damage. That’s why we added a rocket launcher. If that doesn’t solve your problem, you’d better get the frag out of there!

**Samuvani Criscraft Otter** (w/ rigger adaptation, pop-up heavy weapon mount: Aztechnology Striker launcher w/ airburst link, 6 high explosive rockets)

----

## Armed Aztechnology  
### Nightrunner Pack  
_(58,900 nuyen)_  

The Nightrunner is the ultimate smuggler’s motorboat. Because you won’t want to draw attention, a very powerful but silenced sniper rifle is the weapon of choice.

**Aztechnology Nightrunner** (w/ rigger adaptation, pop-up standard weapon mount: Barret Model 122 w/ 150 APDS rounds, 100 gel rounds)



---


# ARMED GMC RIVERINE PACK  
_(165,250 NUYEN)_

The Riverine is a heavy patrol boat, often used by security forces and coast guards, as well as runners, pirates, and smugglers. The Pilot rating is decent, allowing you to focus on other things while the craft takes its own helm. This boat is also heavily armed, with a rocket launcher and machine gun. It even has the durability to survive a light amount of incoming fire.

**GMC Riverine** (w/ rigger adaptation, front-facing heavy weapon mount: Onotari Interceptor launcher w/ airburst link, 6 fragmentation rockets, 6 high explosive rockets, pop-up heavy weapons turret: RPK HMG w/ internal smartgun system with vision magnification, gas vent system, 300 explosive rounds, 200 gel rounds, rating 4 autosofts: Maneuvering, Clearsight, [Onotari Interceptor] Targeting, [RPK HMG] Targeting)

> Note: The Pilot can only run two autosofts simultaneously. You may reconfigure which autosofts are loaded with a Minor Action.

## SUBMARINES

### ARMED YMC DELFIN PACK  
_139,800 NUYEN_

This small, consumer-grade submarine sees some use by smugglers and runners. And unlike the stock version, this one is capable of defending itself. By default, the rocket launcher operates only underwater as a torpedo launcher. If you choose, an above-water rocket launcher may be mounted instead, but it’s of no use to you underwater.

**YMC Delfin** (w/ rigger adaptation, front-facing heavy weapon mount: Aztechnology Striker w/ airburst link, 6 anti-vehicle rockets)

> Note: You must choose whether or not the launcher is designed for underwater torpedoes or standard rockets. Torpedoes function just like rockets but can only be fired underwater. The submarine must surface in order to fire standard rockets.

## SMALL DRONES

### ARMED SMALL WHEELED DRONE PACK  
_(24,160 NUYEN)_

These drones are so much fun to drive, and they come in a wide variety of models that make them look like miniature versions of various popular full-size cars. This one isn’t designed for drone racing, though. A weapon mount with a silenced flechette pistol turns it into a stealthy combat drone. Just be careful not to get stepped on!

**Chrysler-Nissan Pursuit V** (w/ standard weapon mount: Ares Viper Slivergun w/ external smartgun system, 100 flechette rounds)  
**Suggested Autosofts:** Clearsight, Maneuvering, Stealth, [Ares Viper Slivergun] Targeting

### ARMED SMALL WALKER DRONE PACK  
_(8,550 NUYEN)_

The Aztechnology Crawler is a four-legged walker drone that is popular with security forces as an inexpensive patrol drone. This one mounts a heavy pistol with a silencer and plenty of ammo, making it a very useful tool for more delicate operations where a larger drone with a bigger gun might draw too much attention.

**Aztechnology Crawler** (w/ standard weapon mount: Ares Predator VI w/ silencer, 150 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds)  
**Suggested Autosofts:** Clearsight, Maneuvering, Stealth, [Ares Predator] Targeting

### ARMED SMALL ROTOR DRONE PACK  
_(8,000 NUYEN)_

This quadcopter drone comes stock with an air-powered crossbow, which isn’t a terribly effective weapon in most circumstances. Armed with Narcoject injection bolts and piloted by a skilled rigger, it becomes incredibly dangerous.

**Cyberspace Designs Quadrotor** (comes standard with air-powered crossbow, 5 Narcoject injection bolts)  
**Suggested Autosofts:** Clearsight, Maneuvering, Stealth, [Crossbow] Targeting

## MEDIUM DRONES

### STEALTHY MEDIUM WHEELED DRONE PACK  
_(7,500 NUYEN)_

The inexpensive Doberman is widely popular among security forces as well as shadowrunners. If you’re looking to go in with as little noise as possible, an Ingram Smartgun submachine gun with an integral silencer and smartgun system is the perfect choice for its weapon mount.

**GM-Nissan Doberman** (mounted weapon: Ingram Smartgun XI, 100 regular rounds, 100 gel rounds)



---


# Loud Medium Wheeled Drone Pack  
**(8,300 nuyen)**  
Security forces are much more likely to mount a bigger gun, like a Mossberg CMDT combat shotgun, on a Doberman. That weapon is dangerous and inexpensive, so why not follow suit?

**GM-Nissan Doberman** (mounted weapon: Mossberg CMDT w/ external smartgun system, 150 explosive rounds, 100 gel rounds)  
**Suggested Autosofts:** Clearsight, Maneuvering, [Mossberg CMDT] Targeting

# Light Anthro Drone Pack  
**(6,125 nuyen)**  
The Nissan Samurai is a fragging human-sized robot with katana arms that mount a submachinegun in each hand. They’re also dirt cheap, so don’t be surprised if a security response team sends a wave of these after you the next time you set off an alarm. Don’t panic, though. They aren’t very tough. That said, they’re cheap enough that a wily rigger might be able to use them for a distraction.

> Note: The Dronemaster can run up to three programs at once, counting autosofts and cyberprograms. You can slave up to nine drones to it.

# BASIC RCC PACK  
_(32,360 nuyen)_

The Spider is a fairly inexpensive RCC with decent capabilities for the nuyen. A serious drone rigger will spring for something better, but if drones are secondary for you, it’s a solid choice. It’s also very popular among gangs and lower-grade security forces.

**Maersk Spider RCC** (w/ cyberprograms: Armor, Encryption, Signal Scrubber, Stealth, Toolbox, Virtual Machine, and four rating 4 autosofts: Clearsight [specific drone] Maneuvering [specific drone], Stealth, [specific mounted weapon] Targeting)

# DRONE AUTOSOFT PACKS

If you are loading autosofts directly onto a drone, the rating is limited by the drone’s Pilot rating, and the drone can only run (Pilot/2) autosofts at once. If you run autosofts from an RCC that the drone is slaved to instead, you are not limited by the drone’s Pilot rating.

Note that Clearsight is **not** drone-specific, so you only need to buy it once for all drones that your RCC controls. If you purchase a PACK that has a redundant autosoft, deduct its cost. Autosofts cost their rating times 500 nuyen.

## RECON AUTOSOFTS

The Recon autosoft PACKs are designed for drones that are used to stealthily observe an area or target. They’re usually smaller, airborne drones.

- **Pilot Rating 1**  
  Don’t bother. If you expect this drone to pull anything off, you’d better be jumped in or running a higher-level autosoft on your RCC.

# TYPES AND SHADOWS

**POSTED BY: RIKKI**

With the emergence of UGE (Unexplained Genetic Expression), goblinization, and SURGE, our world’s common sense of diversity was forever changed. With the confirmed metagenesis in not only sapient species but nearly all species of flora and fauna, what was once purely human (*Homo sapiens sapiens*) has since blossomed into a spectrum more befitting the legends and lore of our world. Geneticists and arcanobiologists alike have been debating and researching variations in the metahuman genomes since. Full genetic mapping was nearly achieved just prior to the arrival of UGE offspring (elves and dwarfs) but was retraced afterward, and again after goblinization took place. Agencies such as Quest Diagnostics and Research, Shiawase Genomics, and universities such as Johns Hopkins (UCAS), University of San Diego (Aztlan), Oxford (Great Britain), Karolinska Institute (Sweden) along with perhaps a hundred more worked around the clock for years even to figure out what had taken place.

Along the way, data encountered the occasional hiccup. Among these newly expressed individuals, there was the occasional being who was further expressed beyond the barely established timeline. They were rarities among the greater commonalities. The first documented and confirmed koborokuru expression was in the city of Sendai, Miyaku Prefecture, Japan in 2031, with no further documented expressions for nearly ten years afterward.

> That’s because a whole lot of them were shipped off to places like Yomi Island.  
> — Lei Kung

There were similar considerations around the world in places with higher than ambient levels of aetheric activity such as Ireland (now Tír na nÓg), Siberia (now Yakut), Brazil (now Amazonia), the

Native American Nations, Eastern Mediterranean nations (Greece, Turkey), Kenya, Azania, India, and even Australia.

> What is rarely spoken of are locations such as Svarbald, Greenland, and Nepal. There were significant expressions in those areas, but they were given protection by the indigenous populations there as the news of events like the Night of Rage started to swirl.  
> The Smiling Bandit

# BREEDING TRUE

One key difference between metavariants and changelings (p. 115) is found in the reproductive process. The key question to ask is, does a particular type reproduce their own expression? This question was foundational to the metaracism and fear that dominated the earlier decades of the twenty-first century after the Awakening.

## CLARIFICATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS

**Homo sapiens** is the base level of binomial identification used to clarify and classify an entire branch of hominid expression. *Homo sapiens* was often used as the broad descriptor for all humanity, when likely the label should have been *homo sapiens sapiens*.

**Unexplained Genetic Expression, or UGE,** is the form of expression for two metavariations from the base *H. sapiens* species: dwarf (*H. sapiens pumilionis*) and elf (*H. sapiens nobilis*).

**Goblinization** describes the expression of individuals from *H. sapiens sapiens* (human) to *H. sapiens robustus* (ork) and *H. sapiens ingentis* (troll). During the onset of goblinization, individuals often underwent dramatic and excruciating changes to their biological form. In modern usage, it is most often used as a pejorative term. Scientists have linked goblinization and SURGE, as they are both connected to rising energies of the terrestrial manasphere and other localized aetheric forces.

**Sudden Unexplained Recessive (or Rapid) Genetic Expression, or SURGE,** is the term used to explain a sudden, often biologically aggressive change in biological and genetic template of an individual. Individuals who undergo SURGE are more commonly referred to as changelings and will be covered elsewhere. In certain groups of similar changelings, the changes to the biological form have been propagated through the genetic lineage and thus passed along to later generations through normal procreative means (i.e., nartaki). So now they are documented and known as metavariant expressions.

**Meta-Variant Genetic Expression, or MVE,** is a term coined by Dr. Kristine Martin in 2079 as the classification used for all persistent genetic variations in *H. sapiens* since the Awakening in 2011.

# CULTURAL ORIGINS OF METAVARIANTS

Identifiable groups of metavariant expression often occurred in culturally appropriate places. Hanuman and nartaki, for instance, both fully expressed in India, with the former also expressing throughout southeast Asia as well as Amazonia. Wakyambi nearly all originated from within the borders of what is now Azania, but gatherings of them were found in the Western Australian Outback and even Peru and Ecuador. Giants were initially encountered in the various Nordic nations, but later gatherings of them were discovered throughout the Andean, Atlas, Pyrenees, and the Rocky Mountains of North America. As time has passed and populations shift, metavariants have generally spread from the point where they sprang up to locations around the world.

## BEING COUNTED AND STILL IGNORED

We might well ask how many metavariant individuals there are in the world, and the immediate answer would be, “We don’t know.” Not only do the powers of the world seldom take up an intensive census effort, but they often hide the numbers of certain populations. Both corporations and governments have reasons to hide some of these numbers—sometimes it’s about covering up their poor treatment of them, other times it’s about trying to ignore populations that, if acknowledged, they might be required to serve.

This means that counting the populations of any metavariants is based on a lot of guesswork. Yes, certain populations such as the nocturna have seen their counted numbers rise, often due to a combination of good PR and improved residential prospects. The populations of the merrow societies have only begun to be counted thanks to data from personal encounters, body-recognition software from surveillance cameras, and growing numbers of government representatives in places such as the NAN (on Council Island), the Tírs, Yakut, Kingdom of Hawaii, ANZAC, and Aztechnology.

> * The information from Yakut only arrived as part of sharing agreements between certain tribal groups of merrow, the Salish-Shidhe Council, and Yakutian ambassadors on Council Island.  
> * Marko  
> * This information is also tied to power shifts connected to the Sea Dragon’s maneuvering and activities within the Imperial Court of Japan. Many populations remain hidden or are left off the books, often by request of their representatives. But to have a voice in the world, one needs to be counted.

A very special mention must go to Renraku. They have undertaken many projects to gain information and undertake census counts in places where they venture. Their work in the Seelie Court has opened the doors for them to reach out to other groups who conduct business there. In Asia, this is headed up by their Shin Chou Kyogo subsidiary, while the Socratic Education Group has spearheaded the task in Europe and North Africa. And of course, Evo, through its open-arms policies toward sapient representation has been helpful in many locations.

# Life and Death: Mortality in the Sixth World  
### Posted by: KAM

Longevity is a complex issue in the Sixth World, made more so in the earliest decades after the Awakening thanks to factors such as inconsistent health care, lack of biological and metatypical identification, public hysteria and bias, and course pure bigotry. Just after the turn of the century, prior to the Awakening, the average human lifespan was seventy-two years. The oldest living human had made it to 122 years of age (Ms. Esmerelda Sinclair of Naples Florida, died in May 2023, with no signs of metatypical expression). When the earliest collections of data on elves and dwarfs became available, which was made more difficult by several data espionage activities, scientists began to see that these genetic expressions had the potential for a longer lifespan.

Then came goblinization and the ork and troll subsets of the *H. sapiens* base. The transformations of these individuals were psychologically and biologically hyper-traumatic to an extent not seen in scientific circles of the time. More than forty percent of the people who transformed during this time died from extreme biological overstress. Nations of the time such as the United States, Russia, Japan, Great Britain, France, China, and South Africa were suddenly thrust into a new realm of species understanding, and the race was on—despite the efforts of some, such as the Catholic Church. The work was further limited once VITAS erupted to distract the world’s entire biomedical infrastructure.

We now fast-forward about sixty years. Medical knowledge rebounded from the lost data of the first Matrix Crash, and we have as a world pushed our understanding of the life sciences to greater and greater lengths. We now have not one, not two, but three generations of post-graduate and PhD members of the Awakened science community working to solve problems and increase our understanding.

To that end, it is now possible to identify through the measurement of telomeres—cellular aging triggers—the potential lifespans of various individuals. For starters, the average human lifespan currently on earth is just over seventy-four years of age, a gain of two years since the Awakening. Dwarf lifespan potential could extend to nearly more than one hundred and fifty years. Elven lifespans could go even longer.

> * Here it comes.  
> * Clockwork  
> * It isn’t as bad as you think.  
> * Butch

Early evidence produced by agencies such as the Moller Institute in the United Netherlands was found to be untrue and based upon beleaguered notes and medical journals of physicians and biologists attempting to understand goblinization. Ork and troll lifespans were initially very short in comparison to other metatypes, but this was discovered to be caused by those early stressors and trauma upon their biological forms during the process, with no additional medical or psychological supports to help them. Trolls, as it turns out, have the potential lifespan of their *H. sapiens sapiens* genetic parents. Individuals alive today have shown natural aging pattern supporting these clarified findings.

As for orks, there is bad news, good news, and even great news. For starters, the “bad news” is that due to the mapping of cellular decay triggers, most orks are still mortals and have near-human lifespans. The good news is that some metavariant determinations possess cellular decay triggers longer than their *H. sapiens* genetic roots. The oni and ogre subtypes show cellular decay triggers of a diminished capacity, which statistically equates to ten to fifteen percent longer lifespans by comparison. The satyr metavariant shows similar genetic mapping to many of the *pumilionis* metavariants, which *might* translate to quite long lifespans.

As our understanding of the sciences progresses, our understanding will undoubtably increase as well. I need to underline the idea that all of this is *potential* and not knowable. There remains nothing equating to a “longevity gene,” and we won’t really know the answers to these questions until we have an expanded collection of data to actively test.

# DWARF  
*(Homo sapiens pumilionis)* METAVARIANTS

# DUENDE (THE DOUR)  
While going over data from multiple new sources not previously available, a new metavariant has been confirmed in the Sixth World. They are part of the *pumilionis* subspecies, and the name duende has been assigned to them. The largest population of this metavariant originated in the Philippines, but other communities have been confirmed in the African nations of Mali-Foso and Niger and in Peru on the South American continent. Noted for their nearly ebon-black smooth skin, almost bleached white or blonde hair, and penetrating purple eyes, the duende are *pumilionis* stock who have suffered significant genetic modification. Originally identified by Purinsu Ribon, a transgenics subsidiary of Shiawase that focused on DNA research and the Metahuman Genomic Project, the duende have recombinant RNA that resembles the HMHVV variant found in goblins (Infected dwarfs).

Duende possess *solar urticaria*, or sun sickness, to an extremely dangerous level, which prevents them venturing out in daylight except during heavy cloud coverage. They possess the same resistance to toxins of their *pumilionis* parent, as well as visual acumen that both stretches into the thermographic spectrum and gives them low-light vision. They are also exceptionally fast, not only in general movement, but in reaction times as well. That detail has cost many antagonists a decent share of broken bones and busted jaws. The duende also have a driving hunger for meat protein: beef, poultry, fish, etc.

What stands out among their traits is that they have some natural immunity to all known forms of the human-metahuman vampiric virus, including the Krieger strain that creates Ghouls.

> And before anyone leaps in here with vast vampiric conspiracy theories, allow me to interject. I’m the one who turned up this information while I was studying those corporations that were nose deep in CFD research. Purinsu Ribon had been using recombinant metagenetic therapy, which is still very experimental at this point, including work involving carriers of HMHVV strains I and III. They were looking at how HMHVV seemed to block infection from cognitive fragmentation disorder, and the duende’s traces of HMHVV may be related to this research.  
> Butch

> Population tracking was ultimately made possible through the efforts of the Genesis Consortium and assistance from the nations of Amazonia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, AGS, and Russia. Genetic sequencing of individuals indicates the original populations were centered in Peru, as well as the Osaka Bay region of Japan and the Chicago Containment Zone (now Reformation Zone).  
> Rikki

> The Chicago and Osaka populations were subjected to SURGElike conditions after being exposed to an aerosol agent deployed in those areas. There are unlisted labs in both places. One of the escapees from the Osaka lab was named Gong. He’s safe, and I can confirm he has no trace of HMHVV infection. These duende seem to all have immunity to toxins, but none of the really bad stuff associated with Infection. Unless you count eating raw meat (not metahuman) and excessive need for sunscreen as being really bad.  
> Old Crow

# GNOME  
Gnomes are shorter than dwarfs and have much less body hair, but they share the thermographic vision of their species relatives. Perhaps their most compelling characteristic is their inherent resistance to most forms of magic.

Gnomes are widely scattered across the world, with significant numbers in Central Europe and Asia Minor. Their lack of concentrated populations means that gnomes often don’t form their own culture, but rather adopt the customs of the areas where they are born.

> It’s worse than that. Gnomes are still being forcibly confined and isolated. Plenty of shadow operations have uncovered holding places in spots across the glob. Amazonia, Azania, Aztlan, CalFree State, France, India, the Tírs, and Yakut all reached out to help provide safe havens for these individuals, helping them get away from their confinement.  
> Frosty

## GNOME CENTERS  
Gnome survivors are starting to build their own communities, in part to ensure the disappearances that have plagued them do not continue. One such community is in Yakut at the northernmost end of Lake Baikal outside the new Evo tube station at Niznheangarsk. The Korrigan have established a refuge within the Broceliande Forest that currently has nearly three hundred individuals.

# HANUMAN

When first encountered, hanumans were wrongly codified as a type of Awakened monkey (*Macaca mulatta*; the rhesus macaque) principally in the Indian subcontinent. Later studies confirmed them as a variant on the *pumilionis* metatype. Hanumans possess the thermographic vision and decreased height of dwarfs but vary greatly beyond that. They are named for the Hindu god Hanuman and possess several monkey-like characteristics, such as elongated limbs, feet and hands; profuse lower-body hair; a lack of facial hair; an expanded aural helix (face); and a prehensile tail. These all combine to make an agile species, often adept at climbing and acrobatics.

Hanuman populations of the world have begun to spread beyond their small collectives. Many hanumans have started entering the megacorporate world thanks to not only Evo but also Regency Megamedia and Horizon.

## KOBOROKURU

The koborokuru variant maintains the thermographic vision, decrease in height, sharply featured angular faces, and toxin resistance of mainline dwarfs. They express more diversely in eyes, body hair, and overall musculature. Their eyes are commonly almond-shaped, and their body and facial hair are less than other *pumilionis* types, which is often reflected in fewer or shorter beards and shorter or sparser hair. Muscle density is lower than the common dwarf, as is their overall bulk. They possess a slimmer, more muscular tone and a higher metabolic rate.

The koborokuru metavariant is most common in Japan, especially among the Ainu peoples of Hokkaido. They have had trouble finding acceptance in Japan, so many are moving to more accepting countries, such as the NAN, CalFree State, India, Yakut, Ecuador, Amazonia, and Vatican City. The latter’s status connects to the sanctuary provided to koborokuru children shortly after the Awakening.

> Koborokuru make fantastic models and are often seen in outlets such as *Modern Metahumanity* or Horizon’s *Notable Peoples of the World* netcast. Many koborokurus have also been finding ways to gain education in political science and the other social studies, giving them a foothold in international and inter-corporate negotiations.  
> WuPing

## MENEHUNE

This metavariant possesses thermographic vision, comparable height to the main dwarf line, and a slightly pointed face. They are more profuse in their body hair, with their thick, full eyebrows being particularly notable. Their nasal protrusions are generally broad and flat, possessing a muscular flap within the nostrils that closes, preventing water from entering. They have long, webbed feet with additional dermal layers that make them a lot like swim fins. Their overall muscle density is less than to the baseline *pumilionis* variant, and they have an additional thin layer of insulating fat across their bodies. All this, combined with nictating membranes over their eyes, makes the species extremely well adapted to aquatic life.

Originally believed to be native to the Kingdom of Hawaii’s surrounding waters, they actually come from transoceanic coastlines, and they are now seen throughout the world. Many communities of menehune share their territories with other sapient marine lifeforms such as merrow, meistersingers, sea drakes, and several rumors say they serve as spies and structural engineers within the Sea Dragon’s sponsored locales.

# ELVEN  
*(Homo sapiens nobilis)* metavariants

## DALAKITNON  
Dalakitnon stem originally from the Philippine Islands, resembling characters of local legends. They are fair-skinned, nearly to the point of albinism, with blonde or white hair and no philtrum on their upper lips. They also possess an unusual allergy to spices, primarily garlic, mustard, sage and cinnamon.

* Dalakitnon possess a unique quality that has not been discovered in any of the other metahuman and metavariants species. This is *gender transmorphism*, which means they can change their outer gender expression at various times.
* Riot
* Are we certain that this is MVE and not SURGE? It sounds like the latter to me.
* Pistons
* SURGE normally happens once in an individual’s lifetime, whereas this expression has been documented as happening multiple times for a single person, with the highest number of changes on record being seven.
* Riot
* Data also confirms that those individuals who have procreated normally transfer this to their offspring. The first instance of transmorphism often occurs when the individual enters puberty. Reverse tracing of data has revealed this metavariant has existed for some time in the NAN, Indian Union, and Amazonia.
* KAM

## DRYAD  
This *nobilis* metavariant appears remarkably similar to the parent line, having a slight decrease in height, as well as being more slender and fair-haired. The ability to accurately identify, study, and understand them was impeded for years due to their supernatural glamour properties, which they used frequently to interfere with observers. These obstacles were changed when grants from the Apep Consortium enabled teams to reach out and engage populations of dryads in the Papua-New Guinea isles.

* “Enabled” meaning people hired shadowrunners to go in and extract individuals of various ages and sexes. The research yielded a lot of results, but lots of people were displaced, and many of them have completely disappeared.

> Butch  
> Butch is correct. My contacts mentioned this to me a few years ago, but all leads went cold incredibly fast. The Tírs have been petitioned to investigate the events, but they have not responded.  
> Marko

Dryads often possess strong supernatural prowess. Because of their strong symbiotic nature, they often keep close association to natural environments, which they strongly defend. A few dryads have begun to venture forth farther and farther abroad into the world, though all eventually return to their home territories.

Dryads are found on nearly every continent (except Antarctica) and can express as offspring from nearly all branches of the *homo sapiens* family tree. Some believe this odd expression may have at one time been the source of pre-Awakened tales where faerie beings would sneak into the nurseries of new families and replace a child with one of their own. Modern methods of blood typing and phenotypical analysis have long since banished this myth, but legends are tough to shake entirely. Because of their wide-reaching expression among metahumanity, they do not have a singular cultural home.

* It is astonishing, but on the metahuman trafficking markets, dryads remain a top prize. Some of you may remember the news a few years back of the dryad “farm” that was found in the jungles of Amazonia, with over a hundred mature women and children of all sexes present? A similar “farm” was discovered out in the taiga of northern CIS (Russia), only this time all individuals found were suffering from an array of neurological impairments. Investigations into this incident failed to lead to any prosecutions.  
> Lyran

## NOCTURNA  
The Night Ones. Blackhearts. Dark elves. This metavariant of the *nobilis* subspecies has suffered greatly among many societies, especially those of a more superstitious leaning. Nocturna exhibit mostly the same expressions of the *nobilis* parent, with increased body hair growth, slightly reduced auditory sensitivity, and strong hypersensitivity to bright lights. That last leads most nocturna to be, well, nocturnal. Their body hair is a layer of short, dark fur covering that usually covers their face. The same hair is not found on their palms, bottoms of their feet, eyelids, and genitalia. This body fur is often black, sometimes it is violet or deep purple. Even less common colors include deep burnt orange, dark green, and tarnished bronze.

**TYPES AND SHADOWS // LIFE AND DEATH: MORTALITY IN THE SIXTH WORLD**

Nocturna biorhythms are directly tied to the night/day cycle, and they prefer nighttime activities. The reasons for this are still being pursued, but even genetic therapies have been unsuccessful in changing this for a sustained period. When by necessity or choice they are awake during daytime hours, they suffer in much the same manner than other individuals might if they stayed up too late, showing increasing fatigue and stress.

## WAKYAMBI

Wakayambi were perhaps the most isolated metavariant at one point. They possess the same low-light vision as elves, and the longevity as well, but they are notable for their height—wakayambi hit the same three-meter heights as trolls. Most have the dark skin and tightly curled hair common in Africa, though there are now two confirmed individuals with albinism.

Wakyambi are more disposed to magic abilities than most metatypes. Most individuals continue to dwell in tight-knit communities in Azania, with many of their youth venturing out into the world during their “Dreamwalk,” which normally lasts about five years. The Evo Metaergonomics agreement with the Zulu nation, combined with greater understandings that come with time and patience, have encouraged wakayambi tribes to slowly integrate with some elements while developing and adopting green technologies such as solar and wind generators and newer water reclamation technologies. They use no combustible fuels and produce no toxic waste sites.

> We don’t see you putting down the wireless yet, so why should they?  
> — Netcat

> Wakyambi have been working toward a fuller understanding of the world, and that includes the megacorporations and other comparable agencies. Their work with Metaergonomics has already established new conservation preserves and is helping in the development of green technology. They still don’t allow visitors to their communities without an invitation or a very thorough examination period, and those examinations involve Mind Probes and other magically augmented techniques.

> What happened to their “sky tribes” legend connecting them to the peoples of the past?  
> — Mika

> Those fairy tales still exist and will likely remain a strong part of the underpinning to their own cultures and those of the peoples around them. Believe me, they are not from another world.  
> — Rain Queen

## XAPIRI THËPË

This metavariant of the *nobilis* subspecies remains the most self-isolating of all. They possess the same low-light vision, longevity, and fair hair as their *nobilis* parent, and their skin is their most striking feature. It produces chlorophyll within patches of chloroplast-containing cells, allowing them to produce energy through photosynthesis. The dermis layers begin with these patches around the aural, cranial, and posterior portions of their bodies, expanding as they get older, with those reaching full maturity (roughly forty-five years of age) having the patches across their entire body.

Xapiri thëpë have been working to maintain their isolation with greater zeal due to the discovery that their skins are detectable in certain wavelengths of ultraviolet light, which generates a photoreactive response in them. They decided if they can be more easily detected, they should put in extra effort to remain out of sight.

# WAR OF THE BLOODY SPIKES

Xapiri thëpë peoples remain in a lengthy protracted conflict that many refer to as the “The War of the Bloody Spikes.” Several xapiri communities and their allies have been trying to stop the proliferation of a species of Sangre del Diablo trees that have been corrupting and twisting the nature of xapiri they manage to capture. This corruption takes the form of thorns of various lengths, which have been seen penetrating the skin of the xapiri who have been sacrificed to the trees. They often continue to slowly drip blood or a blood-like ichor long afterward.

Ambassadors and representatives from various xapiri tribes have begun reaching out to nations around them, or those who are willing to meet privately with them in places such as Council Island. The Indian Union, Naga Kingdom, Kingdom of Hawaii, and Yakut have hosted meetings with these representatives, though no one has information on any agreements that came out of them.

With regard to the trees, the Sangre del Diablo (*euphorbia diabolis*) are an off shoot of the Sangre del Drago trees, which are a major source of pharmaceutical products. In the past, the species has been a bane to all animal life around it, and they are treated as a dangerous invasive species by ecologists and parabotanists alike. The trees have never shown anything akin to sapience, with this growing problem involving the Xapiri communities thought to be associated to a group of toxic shamans who treat the trees as avatars and even mentor beings.

## SANGRE DEL DIABLO TREES

**Habitat:** Wet rainforests from sea level up to 2,000 meters of elevation.  
**Range:** Northwestern Amazonia  
**Frequency:** Uncommon  
**Plant Type:** Tree (12-20 meters height, 8-20 meters diameter-canopy)  
**Description:** Possessing large heart-shaped leaves and densely packed stalks forming the trunks of the trees, with the wood a dark ebony-red stained due to the red sap that has a syrup-like consistency. The fruit of the Sangre del Diablo are a bright cherry red in color arising from innocuously colored flowers which can at times double the canopy density and blocking all sunlight from passing to the ground. The fruit itself is some 25-30 centimeters in length and quite heavy, weighing in average of 2-3 kilograms when ripe. When falling, the fruit will drop in a direct line possessing the capability of incurring significant damage by penetrating any living beings below them. The fruit will not fall unless a living being is underneath the tree at the time, and overripened fruit simply decay in place releasing their corrosive contents to fall below to the ground.

**Usage:** Saplings can be harvested, though it is a costly and time-consuming process. The wood retains its fire-resistant quality and is also resistant to not only their own corrosive fluids but other corrosives as well and is quite durable (barrier 12)  
**Availability:** 8(I)

**Skills:** Athletics 3 (Throwing +3, seed pods only), Close Combat 4 (roots entangling only), Sorcery 6 (Counterspelling only)  
**Powers/Qualities:** Compulsion, Corrosive Secretions, Engulf (Plant), Hardened Armor, Immunity (Corrosives, Fire), Mystic Armor. One in six mature trees are Dual Natured and possess Regeneration.  
**Attacks:** Seed Pods (Fruit): DV 3P, Attack Ratings 10/8*/–/–/–. Engulf (Roots/Vines): DV 3S Attack Ratings 6/8*/–/–/–.

\*Attacks from the seed pods can only happen below the canopy of the tree. The engulf attack is more direct, as the tree uses its surface roots and vines that often grow along its trunk to lash out. The maximum distance of these attacks cannot exceed more than one-half, rounded down, the distance of the canopy from the trunk in meters.

Other details. This has shown a total of more than 150,000 individuals with this trait spread across several nations, including eastern Ecuador, Peru, Aztlan, and Amazonia. The intel has been dispersed, with most of those individuals going dark shortly after.

# Human  
*(Homo sapiens sapiens) Metavariants*

Since the beginning of the Awakening, and the extensive several thousand-year period, humans (*H. sapiens sapiens*), are considered to have been the carrier stock of the entire metahuman and metavariant code sequence. And while the entire human genome was mapped prior to the Awakening, it still wasn’t clear what each gene sequence influenced. We now understand enough to realize that exposure to consistent, ambient levels of mana worked as a trigger for the expressions we see today. Currently, science and research continue to work toward a more complete understanding.

> I still do not understand how geneticists have been unable to fully map all the expression associations since there was a full mapping on the human DNA to begin with. What gives?  
> Stone

> This is complicated, but we must remember that observation of the genomic sequences requires incredibly powerful electron and phased energy-array microscopes. Observing aetheric energies requires a living or spiritual being with direct observation capacity. Those microscopes are technological in nature, and there have been no breakthroughs allowing someone to astrally perceive using them. New techniques are no doubt being pursued by researchers around the globe, and maybe even a few in zero-G environments on orbital platforms.

There are also now pursuits involving those with Resonant abilities to assist in identifying these markers. It is also important to remember that most people with magical capacity rarely go into the extended life sciences, which limits the field of researchers who can aid in these pursuits.  
* Rikki  

* These pursuits are what has garnered the attention of otherworldly forces. Your world’s understanding of … science … continues to make them uneasy, no matter how supportive many may seem to be.

## Nartaki

The earliest known metavariant of the *H. sapiens sapiens* documented at this time was first confirmed in the Indian Union during the years leading up to and during the passing of Halley’s Comet in 2061 and then again in 2077 with the McNaught Comet. There was an additional surge within the Ganges River that was attributed to an additional five hundred individuals abruptly expressing as nartaki, with all of these being female during the Holi celebrations in 2076.  

Nartakis are readily identified by their extra arms—they have one or more extra pairs. This, combined with varying skin colors and tones, make the nartaki stand-out in nearly any crowd. The additional sets of appendages set nartakis apart as one of the few six- or eight-limbed mammals in nature. Nartakis have also been discovered to possess greater-than-average strength, stemming from a variety of factors including adapted muscular, skeletal, and even hematological support within their body.  

* This fact is changing as more and more paracritters of mammalian stock are being discovered that possess more than two pairs of appendages. Pegasi being one of the first documented such species after the Awakening, with centaurs and gryphons joining their ranks. Keep reading for more discoveries that we have made.  
* Butch  

Additional groupings of nartakis were discovered to be living in the Arabian Caliphate and within the uncontacted tribes of the deep Amazon. This latter information was found through growing communications from the Kawahiva and Yanomami peoples, as part of the FUNAI organization.  

* Hold on! I thought that all the metahumans were exiled from the Amazonian interior?  
* Clockwork  

* No, there are still many tribes hiding out there with the blessings of the jungle. Immense discoveries are still potentially at stake, with companies like Genesis Consortium out of Ecuador continuing to work the negotiations tables with both the locals and Amazonia.

# VALKYRIE

Well folks, here it is. What everyone has been wanting to see. In late February 2082, a series of recordings were brought to the public out of the Deep Matrix from a user known only as “Skywatcher.” We will not be going into his dossier as that is not the subject at hand. The subject is what the footage contained. He had penetrated a commune of extremely reclusive individuals who were hiding out in the upper fjords of Norway as well as on the island of Svarbald. These were humans with wings. Along with his recordings were hematological and base genetic sampling of several of the individuals dwelling there. It was confirmed that there were in fact winged humans living there. Later in 2082, additional footage was found coming from the Indian cities of Varanasi and Gorakhpur of individuals at the Dev Deepawali festivals—more people with wings. So yes, everyone, we have “angels” among us. These are not individuals with vestigial wings, but fully functional wings that, when combined with innate magical abilities, enable actual flight. In India and the SAW they are known not as valkyries but as *Garuda ke Santaan* (Child of Garuda) or just “garudan.”  

* And this is where the fireworks began. Holy fireworks across the planet.  
* The Smiling Bandit  

As it turns out, there were small clusters of these winged people—humans only, it turns out—who had expressed in a SURGE-like manner. Those who had expressed were kept hidden by the Scandinavian Union to prevent these people from becoming the objects of skewed religious devotion or superstition. Similar actions were taken in the Indian Union as well as in the SAW along the old Indonesian and Thailand nations. Early information released by Skywatcher was used as a template by agencies such as the Genesis Consortium, as well as Evo through their ByDesign subsidiary.  

* The part of this that really sucks is that while this was going on, the collective known as raptors was also being confirmed and located in various locations throughout the world as well. This sucked, because in the eyes of those watching, it sure seemed like the “human-looking” changelings were being quickly elevated to the status of full metavariant.  
* Baka Dabora  

* I understand your outrage, truly. But all the testing performed on the raptor collectives around the world have shown no ability to directly reproduce. Further, the raptor collectives appear

To express SURGE-like characteristics in more than a single metavariant. This is how science and medicine still work. The people in the raptor collectives are often cautious about coming forward, and I feel they have a right to be. Both they and the valkyries have become the subject of hotly debated religious discourse, in the great holy capitals of the world. On top of that, we’re still learning about their biology. At this point, information on them is so limited that both sets cannot have augmentations beyond headware, eyeware, and earware.

> KAM

On average, valkyries are normal human height from toe to cranium, with their wings rising another half to full meter above them. Female valkyries have light colors and shades on their wings, ranging from white to wheat and sometimes oranges and reds, like what one might witness during a sunset. Males tend toward grey and include deep violet, blue, and even a raven-like black. Non-binary individuals can match either of those appearances, a blend of the two, or their own thing, with some deep greens seen on their wings. Observation of individuals in the Scand Union and the Indian Union show that valkyrie reproduction is essentially the same as *H. sapiens sapiens*. Unlike the raptors, valkyries do not suffer from alterations to their bone formation or density. They possess a thumb-claw at the vertex of their wings that is capable of inflicting significant damage.

Tests using the Parkinson methodology for aetheric aptitude confirm that valkyries use a form of magical flight that is augmented by their wings. Additional tests concluded that they were capable of having active magical talents on par with their human counterparts.

> Let’s start with a simple fact: Most people don’t think valkyries have anything to do with angels of religious mythology. We have seen enough different forms of metahumanity express themselves to know that these things *just happen*.  
> But when I say most people think valkyries have nothing to do with angels, that does not mean all. It doesn’t take much Matrix skill to find groups of people talking about how valkyries do or do not reflect the will of deity, and how society’s treatment of them (as limited as it has been) reflects on us. Some are upset that these “angels” did not appear in Mecca or at the Vatican. The Vatican issued a brief statement recognizing their “humanity, which should not be burdened by perceptions of divinity,” but that has not dissuaded the more fanatical theorists. Behind the scenes, though, some scientists have said that church authorities have reached out hoping to label these individuals as “cherubima” instead of valkyries, but that clearly didn’t work. It shows, though, that while the religious view of valkyries may not dominate, it still might affect their interactions as they engage more with the world.

## Ork  
*(Homo sapiens robustus) Metavariants*

### Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins share the low-light vision trait of the *H. sapiens robustus* line but little else. They exhibit green skin hues tone ranging from a dull ocher to vibrant forest green. They possess a slighter build and a reduction in musculature. Their jaw structure differs, too, lacking the enlarged lower canines. Instead, they have sharpened teeth throughout their narrower jawline. Their eyes are completely black, lacking distinctive separation of the sclera, pupil, and cornea. The final distinction is the reduced propensity for body hair.

> These folks have had a bad rap for a long time. At times, they nearly pass for humans, especially in lower light conditions, which has led to accusations that they are fairy-style changelings, trying to deceive metahumanity.  
> Red-Anya

> There are no special sponsors or patrons for the migrating hobgoblins, but I can at least confirm that if most of them wind up in one place, they will have a significant impact, as there are nearly two hundred thousand of them in all. Russia has been going so far as to assign them escorts as they cross various national borders to make sure they everyone knows where they are going.  
> Clockwork

Hobgoblins are among the more inherently fierce and determined of all the metavariants. Once it was discovered that their tempers and mood swings were linked to frequent shifts in their


---


hormonal expressions, options to help members of this metavariant with treatments were pursued. And while many of the community and clan representatives utilize these medications when interacting with outsiders, among themselves it considered a matter of pride and honor to simply *be*, in all their emotive and expressive glory. With these discoveries and changes, they have been able to push forward with the negotiations for lands to call their own within Mongolia and Northern Manchuria. Individuals looking for one of these nomad groups or a settlement area should be extremely cautious, as most of the populations do not utilize the mood-stabilizing treatments.

> Their dietary flexibility has proven to be a difficult stigma to overcome in some circles. If an ogre has an urge for a snack or light meal, like anyone else, they will sometimes make the decision to grab something that to them is innocuous but in corporate and employment culture can be a serious faux pas or even labor infraction.  
> Dockhand #204

# The Third Great Exodus

The principal populations of hobgoblins remain in Eastern Arabia and Central Asia, though significant migration towards Turkestan has enabled many to finally escape the ghettos of their original homes and begin the development of their proposed nomadic state. Currently, the largest groups of hobgoblins have migrated to temporary homes around Lake Balkhash, Turkestan, which has made various nations take notice. Russia is one of them, as they do not need another large group of often-temperamental people settling along their southern border. Turkestani tribes and communities are also taking interest as the massive group of metahumans move toward their yet-to-be-negotiated lands.

## Ogre

Ogres possess much of the same physical characteristics of their *H. sapiens robustus* stock, including low-light vision, muscular bulk, enlarged lower canines, and the pointed aural helix of their primary subspecies. This expression, originally documented in larger numbers throughout Europe and central Asia, are somewhat shorter than orks in nature, with smoother skin along with a protruding jaw and a wider mouth. They have a stronger digestive tract, which enables them to consume non-standard food sources such as tin cans and other refuse (though this provides very little in actual nutritional value). They were accused of cannibalism in the 2040s, but that has been disproven.

In the decades following the clarifications of their digestive natures, ogres have been making inroads toward a greater degree of social ostracization, but many still find obstacles in populated areas with mindsets steeped in the older stories. They’re helped by the fact that they are not far off from human appearance, though their muscular build often leads to them to physical labor. Ogres make up a growing percentage of European ork populations and have taken their oft-encountered bias in stride. Many of them have found a home and new life in the Black Forest Troll Republic, where they fill the roles of interpreters and spokes-beings. This in turn has brought a few of their number to Seattle as representatives.

## Oni

Along with the koborokuru, the oni were first encountered in Imperial Japan. As a variant of the *robustus* classification, they were the target of hatred, fear, and even genocide during the years of their expression. During the initial years of goblinization, having an individual suddenly and violently express into an oni metavariant was indeed shocking. They share the enhanced vision and muscular development of the *robustus* subspecies, but similarities pretty much end there. The skin tone of an oni comes in three vibrant shades: bright red, blue, and orange. When combined with a sharply angular eye structure, they gain a fierce and often unforgettable visage. Their ears are prominent, which some observers think gives them an elvish cast. All this cranial composition is then made even more pronounced with horns that rise from an individual’s temples.

To this day, oni are only expressed within those of Japanese heritage, having no other variants documented anywhere upon the planet. They are numerous on the Japanese mainland, which of course also means they are the predominant ork subspecies on Yomi Island. The word oni has Japanese roots, referring to demons found in Japanese folklore. Previous research and documentation have confirmed that in spite of their segregation and subjugation by the Japanese government and megacorps, the oni exiled to Yomi Island were able to build their own culture, starting with a structure similar to feudal Japan, with most following the code of *bushido* and banding together as samurai, swearing fealty to the various lords who established themselves on the island. In the years that have followed, many oni have looked to liberate and educate their kind, spreading their form of *bushido* to other oni living in Japan as well as around the world.

## Satyr

Satyrs are perhaps the most striking and socially memorable *robustus* subspecies. Satyrs have the low-light vision and some additional muscular bulk, and they vary in facial shape, leg structure, and overall body mass. They also have short horns that are often swept back, extending from above

# THE FIERCEST GUARDS

What has been unknown publicly until recently is the placement of oni who have sworn their lives to protect the emperor, his wife, and family. Historically, guards were selected by the most trusted Imperial Chancellors, certain highly regarded imperial patrons, and Ryumyo’s own speakers. In 2077, Emperor Yasuhito decreed that there would be an open challenge given to any individual of any recognized status by his court, enabling individuals to compete for the right to be his personal bodyguard. The challenges were kept small and mostly non-lethal. This contest was held annually, and it went public in 2080, causing a swell in participants. That year, a young oni joined in this contest and eventually triumphed. Igarashi Kazuki rose to prominence through this process and has managed to stay in his position ever since. With the permission of the Emperor (and a begrudging council), Igarashi has created a small but elite unit of guards, each having taken the Rite of the Cherry Blossom, a mystical pact binding them to the life of the emperor, ensuring their loyalty. This unit is entirely made of oni warriors. Each one of them are adepts of the Warrior’s Way, following the Bushido code. They have proven to be quite skilled and have helped to elevate the capability, skill, and honor of the oni in the eyes of the emperor and empress. Which makes the hardliners uncomfortable.

> * This has proven to be a hard pill to swallow for the patrons hailing from Mitsuhama and Shiawase, with the more moderate chancellor appointed by Renraku in 2082 refusing to play their game.
> * Lei Kung

# VIOLENCE AND SEX

In 2078, Alamos 20K and other hate groups were linked to the violence and murder being perpetrated against satyrs. In 2081 however a new link was discovered towards these actions, one which has caused some upheaval in the sex industries of the world. Satyr horns and hooves are in high demand among certain alchemists and talismongers for their inclusion in the “Glorious Moon” preparation that has been making the rounds. As satyrs find themselves worth cold cash, they will also increasingly find themselves hunted.

### GLORIOUS MOON (PREPARATION)

**Formula:** Oxygenate, Unknown Formula, Verbal (Phrase)  
**Drain Value:** 8  
**Cost:** 1,500¥  

This preparation delivers what performance-enhancing products have promised for decades. It energizes the blood stream and improves pheromonal responses in the recipient. The preparation is normally encountered as a small vial of blue or green liquid with the phrase “Bottoms up!” As a performance enhancing draught, it empowers the individual to achieve their full sexual prominence for durations of three to nine hours. It also improves the likelihood of reproductive success. If one party takes the draught, the odds of impregnation are fifty percent. If both parties involved use draughts, impregnation is essentially guaranteed.

The creators of the preparation are highly sought after, both because demand for their product is high, and because competitors would like such an effective treatment to not exist. A satyr does not have to be killed to obtain the materials that go into this, but it is certainly a traumatic experience.

The temples, though a variety of forms have ram- and bull-like horns. Satyrs have elongated jaws, with slender nasal features and cheekbones, along with smaller lower canines than other *robustus* expressions.

Satyrs usually adapt to the cultures where they live. They are solid populations of the subspecies found in Europe, with higher numbers around the Aegean and Baltic seas, as well as in the Black Forest Troll Republic and northern France. New expressions have been contacted in the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains within the Sioux Nation and Salish-Shidhe Council lands. Their reputation as fun-loving, rambunctious partygoers is not entirely unearned, as a great many representatives of this metavariant have traveled widely and found their places in all walks of life. This has earned them some unwelcome followers. The violence that had started against satyrs in the latter half of the ’70s continues to rise, and nearly all high-profile individuals now have security details. Satyr communities have begun to hire security.

# TROLL  
*(Homo sapiens ingentis)* METAVARIANTS

## CYCLOPS  
A metavariant that was first seen populating the Aegean Sea and its many islands, cyclops are even bulkier than trolls and have little body hair, even on top of their head. They are most famous for their large, single eye placed near the middle of their head. Their original Mediterranean heritage gifted them with deeply bronzed skin, they lack their parent subspecies’ dermal deposits. They typically have a singular horn, when they have horns at all. A few rare individuals have multiple horns, placed irregularly in their heads. The inconvenience of those horns led some cyclops to remove them. Some medical specialists thought that implanted eyes could give cyclops binocular vision, but that didn’t work. Even when they have the ocular structures, they don’t have the neural capacity to interpret signals from two eyes. Rather than giving them better vision, a second eye just gives them headaches. Due to its large size, their single eye provides reasonable depth perception.

Where many metatype variants have greatly expanded from their regions of origin, the cyclops have not expanded their areas much beyond the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas, though a commune has established themselves within the Caribbean League as part of the Bahama Islands population. In those sprawls and markets where they are encountered, they are often employed as bouncers, bodyguards, thugs, and scouts.

> *Scouts? Not scouts … snipers!* I’ve seen perhaps half a dozen of this big lads roaming the Carib the last half dozen years or so, each one of them are carrying some very impressive gear of the long-range steel-casting variety. Don’t know how I missed this, as a good sniper is often worth five to ten other crew in the right circumstance, but if I were anyone trying to pull some talent for very specific tasks, I would check these folks out. Worth every nuyen.  
> Kane

> Kane is correct. The Turks and Israelis discovered that cyclopes are more than just muscle, though they still have that. A few commanders have managed to put together a training regiment that fits their short-tempered personalities. In fact, due to their sizable bulk, these people can be fitted out with long-range weapons with considerably more firepower than other snipers normally use. Krime has been working on the sly with the Turks toward advancing this opportunity for expansion. Old Man Krime himself is probably having a grand ol’ time thinking of the roving anti-ship opportunities now. Ya know, because anti-tank is so yesterday.

# Fomorian

This metavariant possesses the same visual abilities, heavy musculature, pronounced horns, and enlarged lower canines as the primary *ingentis* metatype. Where they differ from most of their genetic peers is in their shorter stature and reduced dermal deposits. Their horns are slimmer than those of most trolls, and that helps ease the prejudice other trolls frequently face. An unusual quality of the fomori is that when reaching adulthood, they all hit a similar height, usually within ten centimeters of each other.

# Giant

Where most people think trolls are big, there is one metavariant that quite literally stands heads above the others. Giants average a full three meters in height, with a handful of individuals documented at between three-and-a-half to four. Lacking the horns and dermal bone deposits of trolls while sharing the heavy-set physique and musculature, giants enjoy luxurious facial hair in the males and bak-like, leathery skin adding to their rugged, outdoorsy look. Because of their height, their musculature is spread out more, giving them a more slender appearance that most other members of the *ingentis* subspecies. Giants are also one of the metavariants who have an uncommon genetic reversion—one in four of their female offspring will randomly express to human (*H. sapiens sapiens*). This odd genetic reversion occurs most frequently during the teen years, but it has been observed in one individual who was in her late thirties. The reasons for this are still being explored, with research thus far not indicating external stimuli such as geography, ambient aetheric under-exposure (i.e., mana ebbs or voids), or a parentally associated revertant being relevant factors.

> I’ve been looking into this after getting Rikki’s data crunch (and damn can that guy crunch). Sources, including some that are from obviously prejudicial agencies, has shown the reversion process appears to become a latent expression that could cause the next generation to express as giants once more. Some investigators are keen on discovering this reversion trigger, in hopes of (in their terms) “restoring the proper human to metahuman balance.”  
> — Riot  
> This is very scary stuff. If someone finds this and learns how to use it, all metahumanity could be at risk.  
> — G-Nome

The first giants were discovered in the Scandinavian Union. More metavariants were discovered in mountainous regions such as the Alps, Himalayas, Cascades of the Rocky Mountain range as well in the Andes stretching from Ecuador to northern Chile and on to Patagonia in the far south. Communities of giants began to take shape in the 2050s in locations such as the Black Forest Troll Republic and the Sangay and Llanganates regions of Ecuador.

Many giants moved to the Black Forest Troll Republic in the ’70s, hoping to find a haven there, but like trolls in many other parts of the world, they have discovered that there are not enough accommodations for people of their size. Many of them have since moved on, still looking for a place to settle that truly suits them.

# Minotaur

Minotaurs have no bull DNA in them, but they have horns, wide-set eyes, and wide, flat noses that look bovine. That’s how they got their name. Their build, shorter and stockier than other trolls, doesn’t make them any less bull-like.

Minotaurs first appeared in the Greek Islands and parts of the Aegean Sea, with second generations expressing as far as Istanbul (Constantinople), the Isle of Cyprus, and Barcelona. While their common name might make people think they are great at spelunking through cavern systems, they are in fact finding a strong foothold in shipping and maritime profession, with many gaining corporate citizenship with Maersk, along with their kindred, the giants. SpIn, Saeder-Krupp, and Evo (of course) have also opened their doors to the citizenship and employment opportunities for minotaurs.

Lebanon to Rota and Tangiers. Usually good-tempered crews, and they enjoy having fun and playing the “big dumb brute” role. I think the one with the best humor is the guy who named himself Caspian (without the princely title). He can often be found at Sa Calobra south of Barcelona or the Cabrera Cantina when he and his crew are laying low.

Thanks in part to their growing influence with maritime megacorporations, minotaurs are seeing a lot of the world. It is not uncommon for a minotaur to know three or more languages, including some dialects. Their traveling has also been forging them into great navigators.

# METASAPIENTS: THEY THINK THEREFORE THEY ARE

So, now that sapience has been confirmed by most multinational organizations as well as the Corporate Court in non-metahuman species, we the citizens of the world find ourselves further expanding our understanding of the full range of metahuman diversity. While metavariants are generally considered to be identifiable and progenitive off-shoots from the pre-Awakened *H.-sapiens* stock, metasapients are beings of an obviously non-metahuman affiliation.  
* Ignoring shapeshifters and most of the Infected as well, I see.  
* Marko  
* Different part of this upload!  
* Glitch

Since the late 2040s and 2050s, several species have gained recognition and even citizenship in many parts of the world. In 2081, after serious consideration by the United Nations and painstaking agreement from the Corporate Court, merrow have also been recognized.  
* Some of us in the Emerald City saw this coming a kilometer away!  
* Slamm-0!

Let’s do a quick rundown.

## CENTAURS (*EQUUS SAGITTARIUS*)

Originally found almost exclusively in the Grecian highlands, and later discovered in the great plains of North America and the pampas of South America, these beings come in considerable variety. They typically have a horse body (though variants of other quadrupeds have appeared) and metahuman torso, head, and arms. Usually the torso is human, though ork and elf variants are known.  
* There are confirmed discoveries of feline, canine, bovine, oreamnos, and cervidae centaurs across the world.  
* KAM  
* For the layfolk out here, that’s big cats, big dogs, cattle, big goats and deer. They are incredibly rare, so gaining the trust of these beings is difficult. And many of the other metasapients go to great lengths to further protect these individuals.  
* Marko

## MERROW

That’s right, these beings have finally earned some recognition as sapients, which allows for communities of them to seek full recognition with various governing agencies. Evo, of course, recognizes all of them, with various aquacultural and agricultural corporations reaching out to merrow communities. The Indian Union, Amazonia, Yakut, Aztlan, NAN, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Seattle were the first to extend national recognition and citizenship, with thirty other nations investigating the consideration. With sponsorship and patronage being extended by at least two great dragons and three megacorporations, their push has had enviable success.  
* The biggest obstacle they have had is communication. Certain exo-technologies (adhesive microphones and speakers) as well as cybernetic implants have helped in this, as has the inclusion of a spell formulation utilized by their more magically inclined individuals. One amazing option that has come to the forefront is sign language, which has also enabled them to communicate without the need for vocalization at close range.  
* Sounder  
* They have such marvelous voices here in the deep blue, though.  
* Eeroo

Merrow are a marine species with a somewhat ork-like upper torso, often with ornate fins and ridges along their aural crest and running down their back, sometimes reaching their lower half of their bodies, which are that of a scaled cetacean. Their eyes are larger than a metahumans by nearly fifty percent. When combined with their increased proportions of rods and cones, they receive a wide visual spectrum, extending even to the ultraviolet.

spectrum. Their entire cranial shape has a pronounced jawline that contains thirty-eight teeth, six more than human/metahuman skulls contain, and elongated nasal passages that along with their gill slits of the upper chest, sometimes give them a seahorse-like appearance. They are capable of speech and other complex vocalizations—they kept this a secret for nearly as long as the naga did in order for them to get a better understanding of surface dwellers and our many idiosyncrasies without the bother of having to respond to us.

> Let’s just be honest, they took advantage of our shared arrogance.  
> Sounder  
> No argument there.  
> Eeroo  

Their body colors are similar tones and shades of their aquatic dwellings, likely for camouflage purposes. During times of high stress or courtship rituals, their secondary and pectoral fins often change color and flare out in incredible displays.

> The Merrow language—er, rather, languages—utilize color and sound frequencies well outside the average metahuman range to carry on a full conversation. It took me some special gear and a friend’s Digidog to get that point across to me. The mutt could hear them, and it made him anxious, which set off my ears-gal’s hardware.  
> Kane  

With assistance from other maritime natives, communications and understanding of the merrow has expanded. They have a higher propensity for Awakening to magic, as magicians and adepts of various paths, with all members of the species exhibiting at least passive prowess. This, combined with many of their other traits, enable them to dive to far greater depths unaided than any airbreather can achieve, with larger communities of merrow found beyond the three-thousand-meter mark, or approximately sixteen hundred fathoms.

As water breathers with no bipedal capacity, they need special assistance if they journey on land. Many of those magically inclined that function on land use levitation and air-breathing magic, though there are some developments in personal mobility devices being explored for them.

## Naga (Custos Serpens)

If there was an example of metahuman hubris combined with conspiracy, the naga are it. Originally viewed in the ~~first~~ decades after their appearances as trainable paracritters best suited for paranormal security details and bolstering magical defenses, the naga were in fact a sapient species who operated around the world in an “observe and learn” mode. Though first discovered in 2013 in what was then Laos and Cambodia, they learned by guile and observance a great deal about the metahuman world, including subjects such as finance, communications, sciences, and social norms and mores. As nagas around the globe began gathering in places such as Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Manaus in Amazonia, they established areas of self-rule and self-governance. Most recently, discovery of the commune in the Congo Tribal Lands has caused other less-Awakened nations to take greater notice.

Physically, the naga look like large serpents with physical variations that resemble the more mundane forms of snakes, kraits, vipers, constrictors and even cobras. Nagas frequently possess active magical prowess on par with or even higher than most metahumans. Their infiltration into the corporate aspects of our world has progressed to the point that within the ever-open arms of Evo, a naga now sits as the current CEO. They average ten meters in length and just under a meter in girth, though the “naga lords” of Amazonia, seemingly based on anaconda snakes, have been known to get as large as thirteen to fourteen meters long with a meter and half or more in girth.

In combat, nagas fall back to their natural strengths—speed for some of them, strength for others. Many of the population have the venom found in mundane species but of a stronger potency, thanks to their inherent magic. Their global population is now estimated to be more than a quarter million individuals, with the largest centers in Cambodia, Amazonia and the Indian Union. They are eligible for SIN registrations in all the Big Ten megacorporations, several AAs, and nations such as the Bangla Commonwealth, Laos, Malaysia, Manchuria, the Salish-Shidhe Council, Sichuan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.

# PIXIE (*PRÆDICTI FATAENI*)

Pixies are generally believed to have fae heritage, which has made proper classification of them difficult. Their odd habit of *vanishing* upon death has also puzzled scholars. Recently, select anthropologists and parabiologists were permitted to travel to the Seelie Court in a quest to learn more about the massive diversity of metaplanar beings. And while neither vivisections nor dissections were allowed or performed, with various tools and support from the Courts, a workable taxonomy was completed over two years in conjunction with Renraku’s Australian Institute of Magical Research and Genecraft subsidiaries.

As it turns out, the largest population of pixies originates from what is known as the Fae Wild Lands. These populations traverse to our world by way of hidden portals and supernatural bridges that are well-hidden secrets. The Korrigan, a coalition of paranormal entities, spirits, and fey entities, continue to celebrate the creation of the independent nation of Brocéliande Forest within France and have begun exploring other parts of the world to find suitable places to settle. Pixies remain a major force in this group, providing leadership and direction (insofar as this loose gathering allows itself to be led). In addition to the UK, Tír na nÓg, Tír Tairngire, Ukraine, Duchy of Pomoyra, and the Black Forest Troll Republic, pixies now have communities in Yakut, Mongolia, Amazonia, Ecuador, and ANZAC (Papua/New Guinea). In addition to France giving pixies full citizenship opportunities, Yakut, and Amazonia offer such as well. Evo continues to office corporate citizenship, but with the shakedown of NeoNET, pixies that had citizenship are now entering a probationary period. Many have found corporate recognition with SpIn, while a large group has found corporate citizenship within Novatech in newly free city of St. Louis.

> * There is currently a group of pixies talking to the Salish-Shidhe Council and Sioux Nation about applying for citizenship. For some reason, the Pueblo Corporate Council has voiced resistance to this process continuing. No one is sure why the PCC is opposing it, but their move is increasing tension within the NAN.  
> * Snopes

One outcome of the research is the discovery of methods for certain cybernetic implants using methods found in beta and delta clinics. This has allowed pixies to permeate more parts of the world. Amazingly, these techniques do not push the individual to the brink of actual death, but they still approach the threshold. What remains unclear is what happens to a pixie’s body when they die. No one at the Seelie Courts or the Korrigan Circles have the answer.

## VANISHING  
### (ABILITY/CRITTER POWER)

| **Type:** Physical | **Action:** Minor |  
|--------------------|------------------|  
| **Range:** Self    | **Duration:** Immediate |

This ability is most often associated with beings and creatures from the fae metaplanes. This allows beings to literally disappear from the terrestrial world without any trace. When the beings vanish, so does any their personal gear they have upon their self or immediately in their grip (the gamemaster has the final say on what vanishes). In most cases, Vanishing is triggered upon the fae’s death. In some instances, this can be done intentionally, but re-entry to the terrestrial world can only be done at places of strong fae nature (again, gamemaster discretion).

# SASQUATCH (*Pesvastus Pilosis*)

Sasquatches possess many secrets, including where and how they were hiding before the Sixth World. While sasquatch is the common name for the species, they have geographic variations, such as the yeti of the Himalayas, the skunk ape of the CAS, and the yowie of Australia’s Kakadu territories and Papua New Guinea. Normally standing a full three meters in height, with a body covered in vast, rich hair in colors usually adapted from their indigenous territories, running a gamut from dark browns and black to tan and blondes all the way to thick russet red and the ivory whites of the Himalayas.

Sasquatch communicate using sign language due to vocal limitations, though they have some ability to emit high-pitched sounds, often imitating birds if their native regions.

Sasquatch are recognized as sapient beings by most of the megacorporations, with Aztechnology, Ares, Evo, Horizon, Saeder-Krupp and Wuxing giving them corporate citizenship opportunities. Nations such as the NAN, the Tírs, Aztlan, Amazonia, Yakut, and ANZAC offering them full citizenship. The CAS is currently reviewing petitions and processes for recognition, giving hope to populations in the states of Georgia, Tennessee, and North and South Carolina. They normally limit their areas of habitation to natural or ecologically healthy locales.

While most sasquatches are formally uneducated, they can study and adapt. Their communication abilities can be enhanced with virtual sign translation gear, gloves that convert sign language to text or aural words.

## SASQUATCH COMMUNICATION

While sasquatches can learn any language, their ability to make sounds is much less than other metahumans. Their usage of sign language allows them to communicate with others, and if they have the right translation gear, they can communicate with those who don’t know sign language. Signing sasquatches can wear simple soft frame gloves that translate their gestures and movements to text or audio for others to receive. These devices are similar in price and availability to AR gloves (p. 268, SR6) and can be used for that purpose. Additionally, linguasofts exist for all common sign-language variants, though skillwires are needed if people want to sign back.

[The image shows a dynamic, futuristic artwork featuring two characters engaged in intense combat. One character has red dreadlocks, tattoos, and cybernetic enhancements, with electricity crackling around their arm. The other character has horns, tattoos, and is gripping the first character's arm. Both are in a high-tech environment with flying drones and birds in the background. The text on the left side of the image reads: "CREATING A METAVARIANT OR METASAPIENT PLAYER CHARACTER // TYPES AND SHADOWS". The bottom right corner has the text: "SHADOWRUN: SIXTH WORLD COMPANION". The number "93" appears near the top right corner.]

> Because vampires and ghouls are the most historically likely to intermingle with regular metahumanity out of all infected “breeds.” There’s been increasing incidences of sapience, sanity, intelligence among all of them in recent years, so we may see the trend shift, but given that the Infected represent a statistically tiny percentage of the overall population of metahumanity, it still remains unlikely to shift in any significant way.

It’s been years since I first was invited to Jackpoint to talk about the experience of being Infected, back in the old *Run Faster* upload. Since then, I’ve returned to the topic in *Howling Shadows, Dark Terrors* … it’s been a very long journey. And while I’ve had occasion to talk about a lot of things, what keeps me invited in insight into the Infected. Which stands to reason, seeing as I am one of them.

The good thing is, it’s not just me, here. Hannibelle was the one who asked me here, and she’s a ghoul. Thomas “Doc Fangs” McAllister (no relation to Bull) may not be one of us, but he’s one of the best independent experts on the infected you’ll find in the shadows. And we’ve had others chime in from time to time, from EB, a fellow runner and vampire, to Nightstalker, the infamous Martin de Vries, another vampire who hunts his own kind.

While HMHVV has been a part of our world for longer than the Awakening, it only came to light in the 2030s, when the bloom in our population saw us documented by medical professionals. It’s anyone’s guess exactly where it comes from.

Some say it’s a variant of pre-Awakening porphyria or even a form of rabies. I tend toward the for-

mer, but considering there are vampires, nosferatu, and perhaps some other breeds that were in operation in at least the Fifth World, it stands to reason it has always been its own thing, with only tangential similarities with conditions that make sunlight a hazard and blood a necessity.

Today, we represent a rapidly shifting perception. Once we were the bogeymen who haunted the sewers and nightclubs, inspiring the primal fear of being consumed or, even worst, turned; we now find ourselves slowly, unsteadily integrating with society. An increasing number of territories, both national and megacorporate, are shifting laws away from authorized bounty targets to potential citizens, albeit in a limited, often licensed fashion.

> Meaning corporations are finding more uses for them, and hunters are finding less places to pull in a legal paycheck.  
> Kia

> Read “legal” as “official.” Plenty of local groups still pull together funds to form cullings for local ghoul populations. And of course, a SIN is no defense against someone placing a legal bounty on you if there is precedent.  
> Hannibelle

The path hasn’t been easy, but it’s been some years since Fear the Dark or the Mealtime Killer made headlines with horrifying bodycounts, and the Horizon press campaigns for Asamando, both as a respectable national entity as well as encouraging immigration to its expanding cities, have begun to take root in the minds of people across the world. The fear remains, but sympathy and even fascination have begun to take root, in one fashion or another.

> The fascination has always been there, at least for the deluded or the psychopathic. The lure of the forbidden, immortality, or simply a desire to be the predator rather than the prey are more common than anyone cares to admit.

> You can bet that’s the real reason corps love to research HMHVV. You can talk all you want about HMHVV plasmid substitutes for nanotech surgery, but everyone wants to be the one to sell eternity. Leónization is just the stopgap until they crack the code and offer immortality on an installment plan, no drawbacks attached.  
> The Smiling Bandit

With that in mind, it’s worth noting that behind the perceptions and politics, we Infected have been going through changes over the past decades. It defies scientific explanation, like so much else about the condition, but all of us, no matter when we were turned, have felt its touch. An increase in the sharpness of both appetite and sensitivity to our select weaknesses, often sunlight. Moreover, many of us are developing additional abilities or exaggerated forms of extant qualities. Whatever the virus has made us, it seems it is not done.

With all these developments, you can expect to find Infected more and more among the shadows, whether smuggling immigrants to Asamando, dealing with 162s on the warpath, or making a rescue from a Tamanous flesh farm. Sooner or later, you’ll likely deal with an Infected, whether as an ally or an enemy. And if the worst should happen, and you find yourself among our number, it’s worth it to know what your new life entails.

# What It Is, What It Wants  
### Posted by: Doc Fangs  

Infection is the broad-strokes name for those who have contracted the human-metahuman vampiric virus, or HMHVV, a metamagical retrovirus that mutates (often painfully) the host into a predatory form that tends to share several characteristics between its varied expressions: a vulnerability to sunlight and a cannibalistic urge for other sapient beings.  

> It should be noted that HMHVV should have been renamed when the bandersnatch was first documented, as sasquatch are not metahuman but are sapient. Further, social progress tends to make no distinction overall between human and metahuman any longer. It might be more appropriate to refer to it as SSVV, or sentient/sapient vampiric virus.

The Hunger is an instinctual compulsion to feed the virus, which effectively acts as a parasitic entity that uses the host to survive. The virus has an ineffective capacity to sustain itself in its hosts, requiring more life energy than the body could produce under normal circumstances like other metahumans. The host is altered and optimized to this purpose, given a host of new abilities that enable it to stalk its prey. Strain I feeds upon the life energy, or perhaps the connective metaphysical sense, to replenish itself. Strains II and III have lesser demands, capable of taking their spiritual nourishment from residual energies locked in the flesh and bone of victims. While research for a suitable substitute continues, (whether out of altruism, profit, or fame), at present there is no known alternative to cannibalism to maintain their health.  

Questions continue to plague the scientific community about a number of the abilities of the Infected. Why is sapient flesh and soul more nourishing than clone nulls? Why does the virus have so many specific weaknesses when it makes such an effort to optimize its host for the hunt and perpetuate its survival? There are some theories about some of their behavior; perhaps the desire to feed on their own species is also a breeding compulsion. Perhaps the complexity of sapient souls holds some clue as to why they cannot feed on animals, or an in-

compatibility prevents the virus from crossing the zoonotic barrier. We are left, inevitably, with conjecture rather than answers. The virus is a complicated, slippery thing that defies easy classification.

> If the virus ever did cross the zoonotic barrier, it would be one devil rat away from apocalypse.  
> The Smiling Bandit  
> One more reason to purge the rogues.  
> StakeNBake  

The virus comes in three basic strains (also called types), as well a variant on Strain I, each of which can potentially have differing expressions depending on the host. I’ll give a basic explanation of each, and while there’s harder data below, I’ll focus on the appearance, mindset, and personality generally attributed to each.

## STRAIN I, HARZ-GREENBAUM  
*Ghilani Vrykolakivididae*

This is the first strain, identified in 2034 by Dr. Emil Harz and Dr. Carla Greenbaum. Presently considered the base of the virus from which others evolved, it is responsible for strains that have the most dangerous and voracious appetites, as well as the most extreme requirements for infection. It can lead to the full consumption of the potential host’s metaphysical form.

> Note that this means potential hosts who have diminished metaphysical presence, such as from debilitating drug addiction or an abundance of cybernetic or bioware augments, are unable to be Infected. The virus simply can’t take root.  
> KAM  

> I rather think it has more to do with rejection syndrome in street samurai, with regeneration unable to keep up with pushing out that much metal and plastic. Then again, that wouldn’t explain the drug connection. Hmmm …  
> Butch  

> It’s also of special interest that Strain I has the most extra-metahuman sapient expressions, namely jabberwocky, lamias, nibiinaabe, chiron …  
> Red  

> But not uniquely. Strain II has bandersnatches, but we’ll get to that in due course.  
> Doc Fangs  

## VAMPIRES > HUMANS, WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS

This Strain is the most famous of the Infected aside from ghouls, considering their name is on the label. The vast majority of vampires derive from human hosts, with a few metahuman exceptions. Physical appearance is largely unaffected beyond the skin growing more pale, though extreme emotions and hunger can provoke glowing red eyes and extended, sharpened canines. With exceptional allergies to both sunlight and wood, vampires find urban settings optimal. Unlike many other strains, vampires almost never lose any cognitive sapience, sanity not withstanding, leading them to relate to their prey, for better or worse. Their feeding preference is the most varied of all Strain Is, so long as there is a strong emotional connection, from ecstasy to terror to hate.

> My friend Seamus is a vampire and a dwarf. While rare, vampirism is easily the most adaptable form of HMHVV, including several regional offshoot forms such as the Filipino/Malaysian Amalanhig, which has a series of probosci under its tongue for feeding, or the Caribbean Sukuyan, which is capable of consuming fruit juice and rum, requires salt as part of its diet, has no trouble with buoyancy, and lacks resistance to toxins and narcotics.  
> Doc Fangs  

> “Regional” meaning infection of a geographical location or those native to it?  
> KAM  

> That’s an excellent question, one for which I unfortunately don’t have an answer …  
> Doc Fangs  

> You want a real life-saving bit of advice from ol’ Uncle Kane? Keep your eye open for Sukuyan if you’re ever dealing with pirates or boccor. Seems they like to use a bit of the ol’ voodoo to make them real pliant-like, which is a real bitch in a fight.  
> Kane  

> That and wood-pulp bullets, right?  
> /dev/grrl  

> Could you stop reminding him?  
> Red  

> Relax, kid. Just not too much.  
> Kane  

## GOBLINS > DWARFS

Dwarfs infected with Type I lost most of their hair and body fat, becoming emaciated, their skeletons showing through green-tinged skin. Ears often elongate to elven proportions, as well as longer fingers and often toes. In a hunger state, their eyes take on a sick, greenish shine. Unlike vampires, they don’t seek blood so much as flesh, meaning there are fewer “survivors” of their attacks who become Infected themselves. Like ghouls, they can supplement their cannibal needs.

with other sources of raw meat. Mental faculties take a big hit, but in recent years they have expressed greater sapience, ending the UN’s debate about this subject. With a milder vulnerability to sunlight and a weakness to iron, goblins are more likely to haunt abandoned and hazardous locales, particularly given their immunity to fire. They seem to have no preferences when it comes to emotional connections, but fear and agony are a good bet, considering the state of their victim during their chosen method of feeding.

> You’d be hard pressed to find these little goobers in general. Quiet as can be, cunning, and they’ll fit through all kinds of small spaces with those slender bodies. Odds are even if they don’t infect you, some awful shit they’re carrying in their filth lays you up after, anyway.  
> StakeNBake

## BANSHEE > ELF

The elven expression of Type 1 becomes gaunt and haunting, as they acquire the supernatural ability to inspire fear in their victims, their preferred emotional feeding state. For the most part they are otherwise quite similar to vampires, though they have always been more sensitive to sunlight and have an additional weakness against silver. They seem to have a greater likelihood of Awakening, but this isn’t confirmed. Their preferences tend to shape them into sociopathic predators, thinking in terms of fear at all times, though some few manage to keep their violet-eyed hungers in check.

> Banshees were not originally known for their screams. Rather, the screams were those of their prey. Recent mutations have given many of them the ability to weaponize sonic emissions, effectively paralyzing victims with terror. Others have reported screams as a weapon to shatter windows or jam guns, but this seems to be a customized variant of spells rather than an inherent ability.  
> Thorn

## WENDIGO > ORK

Wendigo experience some of the more dramatic transformations, with a thick, mangy pelt of white hair growing across their now-troll-sized bodies. Without exception, they Awaken into shamanic practices, even if previously following a different path, nigh-universally following toxic traditions to enable their preferred method of feeding. Which is not a pleasant one—Wendigo prefer the taste of cannibal flesh. They form cults to hunt others; as their followers consume their victim, so in turn are they consumed by their master, eyes burning like orange coals. Their vulnerability to ferrous metals is scant advantage, considering wendigo are certainly accompanied by their fanatical victims, and worse, have a habit of gathering into covens of their own.

> There were reports of one of these cults out in the Plastic Jungle of Seattle some years ago. The lingering horror is the survivors of the cult, who had to be rehabilitated after all the magical conditioning the wendigo had used to turn them into feedstock. Rumors persist not all of them were really brought back, and deaths in the area have a tendency to spark new local witchhunts. Wendigo don’t just eat people, they ruin communities for generations to come.  
> Traveler Jones  
> Please note not all wendigo go so bad. Some fight their compulsions and are victims, themselves.  
> Twist  
> Horror is generational. Prey one day becomes predator.  
> Many-Names  
> That could apply to anyone, not just the Infected.  
> Hannibelle

## DZOO-NOO-QUA > TROLL

Trolls undergo gross mutation, possessing hyper-accentuated regenerative abilities to the point of growing in size and expressing extreme exodermal growth. Horns grow in both size and number, while the normal dermal plating trolls enjoy become thick armored plates that cover the majority of their bodies, covered in random additional growths. Dzoo-noo-quas have less vulnerability to sunlight than other infected, as well as an inherent resistance to magic. Indeed, their entire evolutionary imperative seems to be based on defense making for a good offense. Unfortunately, their massive appearance does not result in slowed movement, and dzoo-noo-quas are capable of pursuing prey at speed, eyes glowing a sickly yellow, taking down victims and consuming their flesh as they writhe in pain—their desired “flavor.”

> People thought they were dumb as stumps for a long time, but whether that’s a matter of metaprejudice or lack of observation, they’ve been shown to be capable spellcasters and fighters. Rumors even place one in a mercenary company duel-wielding HMGs, if you can believe that.  
> Picador

## JABBERWOCK > SASQUATCH

When a sasquatch is infected with Strain I, it becomes a Jabberwock, undergoing a relatively mild transformation. Its pelt shifts to black, its teeth become slightly longer and significantly sharper. Relatively similar to vampires, their eyes glow red in hunger, and they pursue a strictly haemovoric diet, with a similar inability to digest solid foods and no

tolerance for alcohol whatsoever. With additional abilities of camouflage like a bandersnatch and the capacity to induce fear much like a banshee, and confusion besides, jabberwock are solitary apex predators wherever they make their territory. Their hunting seems to be focused around an emotional connection to the despair they inspire in prey, and considering the arsenal of camouflage and emotional manipulation they have at their command, this is a relatively easy task.

> Despite the implication of the name, Shield Wall’s Frumius is suspected to be a jabberwock. With adaptive camouflage, it’s easy to see how he stayed out of the limelight for so long. After all, he dyed his fur back when he was on stage.

## 'BUT IT'S IN THE BOOK!'

While Infected PC rules are made available for those groups who agree to use them, players shouldn’t hold it against a gamemaster who doesn’t want to include them as viable character options. The necessities, challenges, weaknesses, and advantages varied Infected have to contend with can come to dominate a group’s time and resources. While some groups may embrace the opportunities this may afford, others may not want to distract from core experience as professional, probably murderous criminals for hire by adding sun-shunning cannibals into the mix. If you get the chance to play an Infected, make sure the gamemaster and the group are on board for the ride, and use it to enhance the story for everyone. Otherwise, these rules are better used building enemies as part of the gamemaster’s toolbox.

## CHIRON > CENTAUR

Among the non-metahuman sapients who can be infected with Strain I, chirons are easily the most social, feeding upon the joy of wild celebration much as wendigo feed upon cannibal impulses. Their charm is incredible, combined with the ability to manipulate entire crowds of people emotionally. Physically, they are quite lean and muscular, with dark, shining hair and coats. Hoof and nail increase in density and sharpness, and while their sharpened, retractable canines suggest a haemovoric diet like vampires, they prefer to consume the flesh of their still-living prey, eyes glowing in sylvan shades from yellow to green as they do so.

## LAMIA > NAGA

Lamia infected with Strain I become far more monstrous in appearance, with longer fangs capable of producing a potent, pleasure-inducing paralytic that has seen use in the black market as a recreational narcotic, despite it’s potentially lethal necrotizing effects. Spikes and barbules form around the snout, while scales thicken and darken. Their emotional feeding preference is fairly specific, revolving around wish-fulfillment in their prey. To this end, they have the ability to access and project their target’s deepest desire, be it sentimental or sexual, much like a succubus. Once they commence feeding, their eyes becomes entirely matte black, seeming to consume light rather than generate it.

> Lyran

## NIBIINAABE > MERROW

While merrow are a mysterious enough species on their own, the nibiinaabe represent a terrifying prospect in aquatic environments. With a more pronounced dorsal ridge ending in sharp tines, as well as longer fingers and tails, they are capable of exerting incredible pressure on their victims, crushing them even as they drain their blood with needle-like teeth. Darker and thicker scales and skin sometimes develop ashen grey-and-white streaks, offering superior natural protection and camouflage, though their ability to create zones of supernatural darkness and silence would seem to render this redundant. Their eyes glow green to blue during feeding, when they feel extreme panic, usually via crushing or drowning. A susceptibility to sonic attacks provides a broad spectrum deterrent to their attacks.

# Strain Ia: Bruckner-Langer  
*Ghilani Vrykolakivididae Sanguisuga*  

Argued to be a more “evolved” form of Strain I, Bruckner-Langer is responsible for only two known expressions in humans and trolls, with street legend suggesting there has been at least one elven expression, though this has never been confirmed in any concrete fashion.  

> * It was real. We won’t see another one again.  
> * Ire  

## Mutaqua > Troll  
Rumored to be an experimental result by unknown parties, the mutaqua is a Type Ia troll. Akin to a dzoo-noo-qua, it gains inherent resistance to magic and advanced dermal plating, often forming into pale spikes, but also seems to have an ability to inspire fear, a hunger for flesh and blood, and an extraordinary intelligence. Their eyes burn a pure, blazing white.  

## Nosferatu > Human  
Often referred to as a “super-vampire,” nosferatu are exclusively human, known for an increase in both physical and magical abilities, but also commonly developing psychological compulsions and disorders, notably paranoia and megalomania. This causes many of them to become isolationists, a feat made possible by their ability to burn through stolen life force at a much slower rate than any other infected. Like vampires, they are indifferent to the emotional nature of their prey, but most die in terror as they are drained dry, blood and soul. Most of their body hair is lost, and what remains is shock white. Their ears sometimes grow to points, and their fingers elongate. Central incisors sharpen into hook-like fangs, while pale flesh stretches over incredibly dense bones. When incited, their eyes burn a bright blue or white, or sometimes a dull red.  

# Strain II, Jarka-Criscione  
*Ghilani Moneriviridae*  

Type II infected are distinct from Type I in several ways. Their diets are far more diverse but invariably demand a portion of a sapient product, though the diversity of materials are less metaphysically invasive than those required by Type Is. Additionally, their expressions show a number of novel mutational adaptations suited to hurting styles. These adaptations are put into full use to make up for the lack of regenerative abilities but are also accompanied by as many allergens and vulnerabilities as any other infected, universally including natural sunlight. Much like Strain I, Strain II is metagenetic specific, with each expression unique to the metatype of its host.  

Strain II is also far more common than I, given that it is capable of transmission through bodily fluids rather than metaphysical drain to the point of clinical death. Therefore, use of exceptional biohazard precautions are recommended for anyone at risk of exposure.

> * Gilette  

> * That reminds me: Why are claws sometimes vectors for infection?  
> * Whippit  

> * Simple. Sometimes it’s a fragment of nail imbedded in the wound. More commonly, the Infected in question has been using their hands to put meat in their mouths, which means there’s saliva left on them. Pack your disinfectants and hope they actually do something. Odds are, they won’t.

> * Lyran  

> * Drones don’t get infected, baby.

## Bandersnatch > Sasquatch  
The first documented non-metahuman Infected, bandersnatches are classically feral, behaving in animalistic fashion. While they prefer the flesh of sasquatches (indeed, this is the genesis of the so-called Bandersnatch Equation in academic circles), they are capable of fulfilling their voracious appetites by way of any sapient prey. Capable of breeding among themselves and highly territorial, a group of them are handily able to hold an area as their own, particularly given their adaptive camouflage, which, aside from a telltale shimmer in both the visual and thermal spectrum, leaves them utterly invisible. With their remaining sasquatch facility for mimicry, they set simple but persuasive traps.

# Vacuum Cleaners and Tanning Beds

Canny players may come up with some relatively novel ways to neutralize some of the most intimidating Infected abilities. The two that come up the most are vacuum cleaners to suck up and contain Infected and UV lights to harm or neutralize regeneration and other abilities.

While mist form has some limitations, such as attempting to pass through airtight spaces and potentially taking lethal damage trying to move through a molecular air filter, it is not generally affected by wind or weather patterns, and it resists suction devices. No one is sure why this is, but then, science has also failed to explain where the non-water material of the Infected body goes while using mist form, either. The upshot? No vampire is going to turn to mist, then reform inside your lungs and explode you from the inside.

UV lights are a slightly different matter. While it takes the genuine metaphysical component of natural sunlight to cause actual harm, UV lights, from blacklight to tanning and grow lights, can have a lesser effect on Infected. Effectively, it inflicts allergen penalties downgraded by one step from their normal severity (e.g., Severe to Moderate, Moderate to Mild). It also prevents regeneration and the use of select powers such as Mist Form as normal. This partially explains why you rarely find blacklight at clubs vampires tend to frequent.

that lure targets into optimal positions for them to strike.

* So much for your traps, Rigger X.
* Lyran
* Circles within circles. Just gotta think bigger.
* Rigger X

Bandersnatches are notable for their recent increase in observed possible sapience, as some individuals are rumored to have communicated in recent months. This seems to follow the trend for other previously feral Infected types, potentially showing some measure of hope for those Infected to find a route to symbiosis over parasitism in metahuman society. Indeed, without their camouflage, a bandersnatch looks much like a sasquatch except for its jagged teeth and claws. It is possible, with a synthetic substitute, they may be able to reclaim their former lives.

* I wouldn’t count on it. Rumors are just rumors, however hopeful they sound. And anyway, what, they got smart enough to use Athabaskan sign language again? Color me dubious.
* Nephrine
* Bandersnatch Equation?
* Lyran
* There was a theory some years ago that variegated infected had a dietary requirement exclusive to their own metatypical expression, but this was disproven by examining the proportional strain this would place on a relatively small population such as sasquatches, particularly considering their capacity to breed independently. Put simply: if a bandersnatch can only feed on sasquatch, then they and sasquatch would have died of predator action or starvation over a decade ago.

* Unless, of course, there are far more sasquatches living out there than we know.

## Fomoraig > Trolls

A confusing medley of abilities turn trolls infected with Strain II into formidable, clever hunters. Limbs grow stronger and bulkier, with the upper layers of the epidermis calcifying into thick callouses that almost negate their sense of texture, while subdermal “chestnuts” form that weep corrosive acid, necessitating specialized clothing should they choose to wear anything. Gill structures along the neck provide for long-term aquatic operation, which are often used to lay in wait in rural areas. They favor this environment due to their inherent intolerance to air pollution, operating all the more brazenly with a resistance to magic. While they often favor ambush tactics and unorthodox methods, their mobility and strength means they are more than capable of chasing a target until it collapses from exhaustion or finds itself trapped.

* Word is some of them have developed the ability to squirt that acid at range, lately. So if you’re hunting them, chem gear is a must.

* Who are you, anyway?

## Gnawer > Dwarf

Gnawers have been documented among the Infected for over a decade, but their abilities have continued to develop all that time. Reliably stable compared to many Type II infected, they are inclined to work in groups, particularly as their dietary requirement of sapient bones and marrow compliments the needs of haemovores and cannibals, particularly ghouls, which they have been known to live among. Even in isolation, they make do with the company of various animal swarms, for which they have a supernatural affinity, and their rough, rock-like skin provides remarkable protection. Unlike most Infected, they have reinforced teeth that are designed to crush and crunch bone rather than cut.

> Gnawers have some of the best reputations among all infected, especially in the barrens. They can keep the pests away or use them, they tend to have an easier time finding their meals without killing anyone, and they’re not bugfuck crazy. As long as they don’t infect anyone, they’re surprisingly welcome as protectors, pied pipers, and sometimes enforcers.  
> RazorMay  

## Grendel > Ork

Grendels are perhaps among the more pitiable of the Infected, generally operating as shy, lone scavengers in subterranean locales without a primary hunting instinct. Long, strong arms provide speedy quadrupedal locomotion, much like some primates, while the skin grows a thick, matted pelt. Speech is complicated by overdeveloped tusks, but much like other Infected they have shown an increase in sapience and capacity for communication, at least insofar as they desire it. With an omnivorous diet that is largely garbage with a mixture of metahuman remains (such as those found in graveyards and necroplexes), grendels are optimized for survival in many of the least hospitable places in the urban world.

> There was a big problem with their growing population in the Paris Catacombs a few years back, but discovery of their intelligence and variable habits emerged from a few who made an effort to communicate. For the most part, they’ve been keeping to themselves, moving as family units and feeding on long-dead matter, suggesting that unlike most Infected, they can have their fill of metahuman matter that’s anything but fresh. They’ve made their own strange overtures of symbiosis with local squatters, and their young are growing into the role quickly. In its own way, it’s become an Infected enclave that works well with the world at large.  
> Red  

> Don’t be naive. A growing population only spells disaster in the long term, and you can bet local criminal elements don’t take kindly to them. And don’t forget their well-meaning young are still infectious. How many homeless families are going to forgive the local grendel when it accidentally turns little Francois into a loup-garou?  
> Glitch  

## Harvester > Elf

First spotted in Houston in 2069, Harvesters are a violent example of Type IIs. Elven hosts are twisted into nightmarish forms, gaunt and sharp, with overdeveloped fingers that become bony razors. They hunt with relentless hunger, savage speed, and ferocity, slicing off strips of flesh to eat piece by piece. Their speed is often compared to higher grades of wired reflexes, their strength reinforced by increased muscle density, and their most recent reported ability pairs well with their highly territorial nature: an ability to inflict a hallucinogenic mirage of terrain to throw their prey into confusion. While there is suspicion that harvesters may have developed sapience in recent years, there is no concrete evidence that even this has elevated them into potentially cooperative or even reasonable entities.

> Oh, it elevated them, all right. Where once they were feral monsters, now some of them might be more like serial killers. You’re not making peace with harvesters.

## Loup-Garou > Human

The transformation into a loup-garou is both painful and wracking, the host twisting into a


---


form akin to the classic legend of the werewolf. A short, greyish-black pelt, sharp teeth, long claws, and pure black eyes are only what is seen on the surface. Inside, muscle density both grows and compacts, lending astonishing speed and strength. The brain is often affected by an overdevelopment or maladjustment of the amygdala and hypothalamus, resulting in an overriding sense of aggression that overrides what sanity may survive the agony of the change. These regions of the brain produce various neurochemicals and adrenaline on a roughly fixed schedule, leaving them howling monsters for a roughly four- to six-day stretch out of every twenty eight, tying them to a lunar cycle. During this period, they are far more dangerous, with an imposed urge to kill and feed and additional speed and strength to see it done. With the ability to scale sheer surfaces and extraordinary speed and reflexes, individuals and packs can often represent a very real threat to any area they lair in.

> It should be noted that some loup-garou maintain their sapience, and augments have been developed that counteract their berzerker periods. I know one personally. He’s doing work for a cyberdoc who says they can develop a way to capture the “hunter’s cocktail” into a reservoir to be used on demand, much like an adrenal pump. I don’t know how successful he’s been, but that would make for one hell of an asset.

> Or you could just hire a regular razor-slinger like the rest of us…

## TYPE III, KRIEGER  
*Ghilani Wichtiviridae*

Strain III is perhaps the most famous strain in the world, as due to its exceptional virulence and global distribution it maintains a higher population of carriers than all other Infected put together by several magnitudes: ghouls. Across the world and in every metroplex, ghouls are the singular expression regardless of the host’s metatype. Physically, ghouls are blind. This is not due to any compromise of the occipital lobe; they are more than capable of “seeing” auras due to their dual nature, and they are capable of regaining normal eyesight with cybernetic prosthesis. Along with enhanced hearing and smell, they are skilled hunters, capable of stalking prey and consuming metahuman flesh to survive. They are easily recognized by pale, scabrous, hairless bodies and hardened black nails, which assist them both in combat and in digging underground, their primary habitat to avoid sunlight.

At an estimated ninety to ninety-five percent of the global Infected population, they are immediately recognizable in the public imagination, whether by the activities of the 162 ghoul gang (so named for Special Order 162, which briefly grant-

ed ghouls metahuman rights in the early 2050s before being rescinded), the African nation of Asamando, founded and populated by a majority of ghoul citizens, or the Ghoul Liberation League (GLL), which works to expand the rights and freedoms of Infected across the world. On the corporate level, cures and synthetic flesh substitutes hold the promise of generous research grants and fame, to say nothing of Dunklezahn’s still-standing bequeathment for anyone who produces lasting results in that area. In day-to-day life, ghouls may sympathetically be seen as the topic of biopics of Tamir Grey, a ghoul relief worker whose journals showed his kind in a humanitarian light, or they may be reviled as monsters haunting a tenement, hunting and eating innocent victims.

Ghoul social organization is dependent on the remaining intellect of the ghouls in question. The transformation, both physically and neurologically agonizing, can have varying effects on both the sanity and intellectual capacity for the ghoul they become. Some become feral, driven by little more than pack-hunting instincts. Others remain functionally the same. Some very few find new strength of will in the crucible they’ve survived. Ghouls may build a life among their own kind on the fringes of society, attempt to blend in using cosmetic biosculpting, or seek employment in the shadows, whether as runner or syndicate operatives, usually working for Tamanous.

Notably, no non-metahuman sapients have, as yet, shown any sign of infection, though this may be coincidental. That being said, regional variations exist, such as the African Sasabonsam who have elongated limbs, the Japanese Gaki who have natural glowing eyes, and the Filipino Busaw, which has an allergic reaction to citric acid.

It’s still not juicy enough to be at the forefront of any AAA megacorps’ research priorities, but a new generation of biohacker labs have been inspired by the prizes to be won. You can bet there’s work to be had on datasteals and headhunting between these groups.

# Game Information

## Infected Characters

This section provides optional rules to allow Infected Characters to be player characters instead of NPCs like the Infection power states in the *Shadowrun, Sixth Edition* rulebook. Gamemasters are cautioned that allowing players to play Infected characters may create an imbalance between the Infected and non-Infected characters at the table. However, with proper care, Infected characters can add interesting challenges and excitement to the game.

### Infected Lifestyle

Living with a condition like HMHVV doesn’t stop when the run is done. Your doss needs special light proofing. Any real wood or allergens need replacing or filtering. And unless you want everyone knowing what you are, regular deliveries of metahuman flesh and blood from a street doc or Tamanous incur premium carrying charges. Unless you want to role-play out every transaction, every hunt, every safehouse, simply add thirty percent to Lifestyle expenses. Why thirty percent and not a simple lump sum? Because the higher you go, the more bribes and fees are incurred to maintain secrecy and security and get higher-quality cuts and drains. Your corner of the sewer may be lightproof, but even ghouls enjoy the taste of PhD and filet mignon with the right seasoning more than beggars and devil rat.

### Creating Infected Characters

When creating an Infected character during the regular character creation process, the player must select a single Infected metatype positive quality. Use the standard rules for limits on the number of qualities allowed at character generation as well as the usual Karma limits. Take note of the new racial attribute maximums as shown in the **Infected Metatype Attributes** table. Many maximums are higher than the base metatype maximums, but some attribute maximums are less than their respective base metatypes. These new maximums may be affected as usual by the Exceptional Attribute quality.

When selecting an Infected positive quality, perform the following steps to apply the quality. First, assign two free attribute points to the physical attributes; either one point to two different attributes or both points to a single attribute. Then, assign two free attribute points to the mental attributes using the same method as before. Next, adjust the character’s Essence, Magic, and Resonance as appropriate depending on which HMHVV Strain is stated in the Notes section of the quality. Finally, apply all of the Powers, Weaknesses, and new Attacks to the character.



---


Many Infected qualities list reductions to attributes as part of their weaknesses. When this is the case, the reductions are applied after the free attribute points have already been applied. Also note that buying qualities (step three of the Character Creation process, p. 66, *SR6*) for a character comes after the attributes have been bought and assigned according to the Priority Table (step two, p. 63, *SR6*). After the qualities are applied, attributes may then be raised using the standard method using any remaining Karma (step four, p. 66, *SR6*).

Some of the Infected qualities have available Optional Powers. In general, these Optional Powers may only be purchased after character generation and at a rate of one Optional Power every two in-game months. Some of the qualities allow you to select one free Optional Power from a list when the quality is purchased. Each Infected quality lists which Optional Powers are available to that specific Infected type; a character may only purchase powers from those listed powers.

Becoming Infected does not remove the inherent metatype abilities from the character’s base metatype. Once Infected, a character can accept augmentations, though they must adjust their Magic and Essence as appropriate when installing augmentations. Those Infected with the Regeneration power may only accept deltaware augmentations, otherwise their body will reject the expensive augmentations that were just installed.

## Optional Rule: Delta Risk

Ever since Infected began mutating or evolving past their original known limits, deltaware has sometimes (rarely) been rejected from regenerating Infected, sometimes with lethal results. Infected with deltaware who are driven to their last box of health and then regenerate may reject a piece of cyberware if they botch their regeneration roll (if possessing multiple implants, the gamemaster may choose the most appropriate loss, likely linked to the circumstances causing the regen roll). This causes further trauma as per cyberware loss when Infected. This can be especially perilous with cybernetics that directly interface with the brain, such as datajacks or cybereyes, or when the character is especially hurt.

If it’s easier at your table to skip this rule, feel free to do so. But if it provides some more risk and thrill, go for it. This may have the effect of stopping Infected characters from seeking deltaware, which may be for the best; deltaware isn’t just extraordinarily hard to get and prohibitively expensive, but represents an extra edge for a PC with a lot of supernatural advantages already.

## Becoming Infected During Play

It is possible that a character may become Infected through gameplay. This process is almost identical to the process described above. When a character becomes Infected, they gain the appropriate Infected positive quality. Unlike with other qualities, Infected qualities do not have their cost doubled when purchased during gameplay. Any Karma the character has must be spent to pay off the quality. If the character does not have enough Karma, the character enters Karma Debt, and all future Karma rewards must be spent to pay down the debt until the Infected quality is paid off. After that, Karma may be spent as desired by the character.

Becoming Infected wrecks havoc on any installed augmentations. Any bioware drops a point of rating; if the bioware is only rating 1 or has no rating, the bioware is lost. Cyberware is less impacted, but any non-deltaware ’ware has a chance to be rejected by the body. For each such implant the character must make a Body + Essence (rounded down) (3) test. On a failure, the body attempts to reject the implant. This is rather unpleasant and causes one box of Physical damage each day for each rejected implant that the character has. This damage is unavoidable except if the character has the rejected implants removed or if they take a daily regimen of immuno-suppressant drugs. These drugs cost 100 nuyen a month and confer a –2 dice pool penalty to Disease Resistance tests. Characters that gain the Regeneration power must abide by the rules related to augmentations laid out in the *SR6* rulebook.

Note that Infected with the Regeneration power must abide by the augmentation restrictions listed in that power (p. 227, *SR6*).

## Infected and Medical Care

> Infected have a harder time seeing the doctor than most. Sure, your average chop-shop doc works with all kinds of unsavory characters, but Infected are, well, infectious! Availability should increase by 2 to 4 at the gamemaster’s discretion, and prices increased by fifty to one hundred percent to account for specialized tools, expenses, and hazard pay. Contacts with individuals (such as Doc Fangs) or organizations (Like Tamanous or, in extraordinary circumstances, Ordo Maximus or a megacorporation) may subvert these additional difficulties and expenses, but they come with their own opportunities for favors and risks. Have fun, gamemasters!

## Magic and Resonance When Infected

All Infected are considered to be Awakened, and as such are dual-natured. However, this doesn’t mean that all Infected are magicians, adepts, or mystic adepts. Many Infected types do not confer those abilities but still give the newly Infected creature a Magic rating. If an Infected character



---


ever has their Magic rating reduced to 0, either temporarily or permanently, they lose access to all of their powers except for Armor, Enhanced Senses, and Natural Weapons. An Infected character’s aura always reveals its Infected status, and it may be masked with metamagic as usual.

All Infected may freely learn the Astral skill but cannot learn the Conjuring, Enchanting, or Sorcery skills unless they are a magician or mystic adept. They also cannot astrally project, bond foci, or initiate without being magically active like any other character. The Magical Guard power, however, enables the character to learn the Sorcery skill, which may only be used for the Boosted Defense Counterspelling action.

No Infected character may take the Magic Resistance quality. If they have the quality when becoming Infected, they lose the quality, and the Karma cost of the quality is refunded and may be used to offset the Karma cost of the Infected quality.

> ### TRANSFORMATION TRAUMA
>
> The process of becoming Infected is wracking on the mind, body, and soul. The fact that many Infected are also Awakened is a byproduct of the massive metamagical transformation taking place on a genetic level. If a character has some sleeping talent for magic hiding in their genes, the virus will find and make use of it. This can include an opportunity to become a magician, adept, or mystic adept, or perhaps qualifying as an inciting incident for any quality which indicates dormant talent.
>
> Of course, the trauma of the incident is fertile ground for a toxic or twisted tradition to take hold for NPC enemies or darker groups …

## INFECTION AND MAGIC

Characters who get infected with HMHVV Strain II or III have their Essence set to 5 and gain a Magic rating of 1 if they did not already have a Magic rating. If the character already had a Magic rating, they instead reduce their Magic rating by 1. The characters may increase their Magic by spending Karma, as usual, to a maximum of 5 + their initiate grade.

For characters with HMHVV Strain I, their Essence and Magic will fluctuate over time due to their Essence Loss weakness and Essence Drain power. As a character’s Essence changes, so too will Magic. The maximum Magic for these characters is their current Essence + initiate grade. If their maximum Magic rating becomes lower than their current Magic rating, reduce the Magic rating to meet the new, lower maximum. The points removed in this way are not permanently lost, they are only currently not available.

There are two methods to regain these lost Magic points. If the maximum Magic rating is increased, the character may spend Karma as usual to increase their Magic. Otherwise, they can use the Drain Essence power to drain Essence from a victim in excess of the character’s usual maximum Essence. For each point of Essence drained above that maximum, they can regain one lost point of Magic. This second option is clearly a favored way to regain Magic. But be careful, an Essence Drain Addiction test has to be made for each use of the Essence Drain power.

If any Infected creature were to lose Essence to any other mechanism besides their Essence Loss weakness or another creature’s Essence Drain power, that lost point of Essence would be subtracted from their maximum Essence. Cyberware is a prime example.

> ### INFECTED AURAS
>
> Infected are always identifiable by their auras without metamagical masking. The appearance is often confusing—a medley of the metaphysical energies they have consumed, whether through direct Essence drain or the residual elements in the flesh they eat. At its core, however, is a pulsing blackness, reaching inky tendrils along the body like blood vessels and nerve endings. A well-fed Infected is a swirl of stolen life, while a starving one is far darker, with only hollow pale patches waiting for death to fill them in.

## INFECTION AND RESONANCE

All strains of HMHVV are incompatible with being a technomancer. When a technomancer becomes Infected, they lose all connection to their Resonance and all related abilities. Any active skills related to technomancer abilities can be treated as knowledge skills instead. No Karma is refunded to the character when this happens. Former technomancers find the transition to be deeply upsetting.

## ESSENCE DRAIN ADDICTION

The act of draining another creature’s essence using Essence Drain is amazingly blissful and, at the same time, terribly destructive. The violence of ripping out the life-force of another creature and absorbing it can only be subdued by the intense high that it provides to both parties involved in the process. This intimate act is dangerous for all involved.

The high produced during the draining process is so strong that each person may become addicted to the act. The Infected character seeks out more and more victims to drain. The victim needs to return to the same Infected to be drained again, or perhaps worse, to dangerously search for other Infected creatures to fulfill that need.

Each person involved needs to succeed on Body + Willpower (2) Essence Drain Addiction test to

# Diseases

Diseases in *Shadowrun* operate essentially like toxins and use the same base set of rules (p. 121, *SR6*). However, there are a couple of extra pieces to be aware of with them. This discussion contains disease rules that are relevant to Infection with HMHVV and a more detailed set of rules for diseases in general.

## Speed

This is the incubation period before the first effects may occur. After the listed period of time, the character must make a Disease Resistance test using the same rules as a Toxin Resistance test (Body + Willpower + any gear or abilities). The number in parentheses shows the number of tests that must be made to resist the disease. Each successive test takes place after an additional time according to the interval listed. The Disease Resistance test isn’t considered finished until the final test occurs after the final time interval. Reducing the power of the disease to 0 does not reduce the number of tests and intervals necessary to complete the full Resistance test.

## Power

This functions the same way as it does for toxins, but even if the Power of a disease is reduced to 0, the character must still make the minimum number of Disease Resistance tests and Speed Intervals as listed in the Speed. The disease is only defeated when the minimum number of tests have been completed and the Power of the disease has been reduced to 0.

Additionally, the Power of a disease can accumulate. If a Disease Resistance test doesn’t reduce the Power of the disease to 0, add the remaining Power to the Power of the next Disease Resistance test. Only add to the Power of the disease once this way. Subsequent Disease Resistance tests begin at this new, higher Power number. Each test after this point reduces the remaining Power until it reaches 0 or the maximum number of tests have been made.

## Nature

The disease’s type is described by its Nature. Examples include bacterial, fungal, parasitic, retroviral, toxin, and viral. This may affect which drugs and biotechnology can treat or affect the disease. Note that while rumors persist of research and even successful prototypes of HMHVV inoculations and even cures, no examples are known to be in existence, and if they did, they’d be out of reach for almost any runner who needed it.

# Effect

There are two kinds of Effects for diseases: Ongoing and Final. Ongoing Effects are what a character experiences until the disease is defeated. Final Effects occur if the character doesn’t reduce the Power below a certain level within the time as listed in the description.

# Infected Diseases

## HMHVV Strain I

* Vector: Infection power (p. 225, *SR6*)
* Speed: 1 minute (1)
* Power: 13
* Nature: Retroviral
* Effect (Final): Coma, transformation

This disease is only spread by the Infection power and has very little chance of escape from the disease. If the Power of the disease is 6 or lower after the single Disease Resistance test, the character dies. If the Power of the disease is 7 or higher after the Disease Resistance test, the character fails to resist the transformation and goes into a coma for (30 – Body) hours. Upon awakening, the character gains the appropriate Infected quality. The character begins a new life with Essence of 1 and a maximum Magic of 1 + initiate grade (See *Magic and Resonance When Infected*, p. 105). A character may burn a point of Edge to guarantee that they either pass or fail the Disease Resistance Test.

## HMHVV Strain II

* Vector: Injection
* Speed: 1 hour (3)
* Power: 10
* Nature: Retroviral
* Effect (Ongoing): Nausea
* Effect (Final): Essence loss, transformation

This disease needs to be defeated by reducing the Power of the disease to 0 by the end of the three Disease Resistance tests. Success means a full recovery, though they could end up as a carrier of the disease (see Carrier negative quality).

Failure to reduce the Power of the disease to 0 means that the virus takes over. If this happens, the character loses 1 point of Essence. If this reduces their Essence to 0, the character dies. Otherwise,


---


they begin the transformation process, experiencing 15 – Body days of extreme pain and nausea for the entire duration. After that transformation period, the character gains the appropriate Infected metatype quality and goes through the process described earlier in this chapter, *Becoming Infected During Play*, p. 105.

If desired, a character can choose to permanently burn a point of Edge to guarantee that they don’t succumb to the disease. They could still end up a Carrier of the disease though. Any Essence loss due to the HMHVV II infection cannot be recovered by any means.

### HMHVV STRAIN III
* **Vector:** Injection  
* **Speed:** 12 hours (10)  
* **Power:** 6  
* **Nature:** Retroviral  
* **Effect (Ongoing):** Nausea  
* **Effect (Final):** Essence loss, transformation  

This strain is also known as the Krieger strain and is responsible for the creation of ghouls. This disease needs to be defeated by reducing the Power of the disease to 0 by the end of the ten Disease Resistance tests. Success means a full recovery, however, they could end up as a Carrier of the disease (see Carrier negative quality).

Failure to reduce the Power of the disease to 0 means that the virus takes over. If this happens, the character loses 1 point of Essence. If this reduces their Essence to 0, the character dies. Otherwise, they begin the transformation process, experiencing 10 – Body days of extreme pain and nausea for the entire duration. After that transformation period, the character gains the Ghoul Infected quality and goes through the process described earlier in this chapter *Becoming Infected During Play*, p. 105.

If desired, a character can choose to permanently burn a point of Edge to guarantee that they don’t succumb to the disease. They could still end up as a carrier of the disease though. Any Essence loss due to the HMHVV III infection cannot be recovered by any means.

## INFECTED METATYPE ATTRIBUTES

Becoming infected with HMHVV will have a terrifying impact on your mind and body. Infected people often have a much more imposing physique than non-Infected metahumans, but it comes at a cost—usually to the rational and analytical parts of their mind or to their natural charm. The *Infected Metatype Attributes* table provides sets of new maximum values for the attributes of Infected metahumans. Note that some of the new maximums are less than the standard maximum values for the related non-Infected metatype. If a newly Infected person has a higher base attribute than the new maximum would allow, reduce the base attribute to that new, lower maximum without refunding Karma. Attributes may then be modified, as usual, through other means.

### THE INFECTED DIET

Infected universally require some measure of metahuman or at least sapient flesh or blood. Emotional and metaphysical qualities aside, in narrative terms their biologies tend to require roughly ten percent of their body weight in metahuman product each week. This product cannot be cooked, and additives or preservatives tend to ruin the flavor, much as substance abuse can damage Essence. Remaining caloric needs can generally be raw meat from any other creature, as well as additional sources listed under each expression. While not within the confines of this game to measure, narrative increase in appetite for Type Is who have regenerated significant damage is not out of the question, with gamemasters advised to use rules and effects similar to symbiote bioware’s increased feeding requirements (p. 292, SR6) as a guideline for whatever period they deem appropriate. Note that this only refers to the physical sustenance, not any drained Essence.

# NON-HUMAN VAMPIRES

While very uncommon, baseline HMHVV-1 is capable of turning any standard metatype into a vampire rather than the metatypical expression. To date, except for Strain III (Krieger), no other strain has been capable of existing in other metatypes (for example, there can be an ork vampire, but not a human wendigo; an elven vampire works, but not a troll banshee, and so on).

If you want one of these atypical expressions in your game, simply apply the same attribute modifiers to maximums as per a vampire to a human: +1 BOD, STR, WILL, and +2 REA and CHA. Special abilities and other qualities are applied as per the overall vampire quality. The primary difference is that the template costs an additional 5 Karma, for a total cost of 32, as opposed to 27.

Insofar as plot possibilities go, among any normal people any Infected is likely to be reviled. But for those who have a particular interest in aberrant Infected (biotech megacorporations like Yakashima or the genetic necromancers of the Ordo Maximus), such a character can fetch a high price as an experimental subject, making such NPCs (and even PCs) quite tempting targets for bounty hunters …

# RENFIELD

**Vector:** Ingestion, Injection  
**Speed:** 1 Combat Round  
**Duration:** 7 days  
**Power:** 8  
**Effect:** Agility +1, Intuition +1, Strength +1, Euphoria (8 – Body hours, minimum 1 hour), + 1D6 Initiative

Any character who fails to reduce the Power of Renfield to 0 during the Toxin Resistance test must make an Addiction Resistance (3) test (Body + Willpower). Failing this addiction test results in the character gaining the Addiction (Renfield, level 1) negative quality. If that character already had the addiction, increase the level by 1. Like other addictions, the withdrawal period begins when Renfield wears off after the usual seven-day duration. However, the penalties for withdrawal never increase after each withdrawal period once the drug wears off.

Once addicted, individuals are known as “pawns.” When the pawn has become addicted to the drug, they gain the Immunity (Age) critter power and the Essence Loss weakness. The immunity remains in effect as long as the pawn continues to receive a regular dose of the drug. Typically, vampires are only able to provide a dose of Renfield every three months due to the great cost of creating them. When addicted, the pawn requires more doses to maintain Essence. Even getting rid of the addiction does not remove the Essence Loss weakness. Each dose of Renfield gives the pawn 1D6 points of Essence; the pawn can carry up to twice the natural maximum, just like a vampire. Pawns addicted to Renfield have a sixth sense when near the Infected that gave it to them (range: [Essence] meters).

Preparing Renfield is an Alchemy + Magic (16, 12 hours) Extended test. Any glitches during the test reduces the Essence that is imparted by the drug by 1 point per glitch. A critical glitch causes the entire enchantment to fail, and the Vampire loses a point of Essence. As with other preparations, an Awakened individual can assense a dram of Renfield to acquire an astral signature or use it as a link for a ritual. A dram of Renfield can be spoofed provided the magician has assensed the vampire’s aura.

# Negative Infected Qualities

## Carrier (Type)

Good news, chummer! You’re not infected with HMHVV! Unfortunately, you now carry the virus around with you, and you’ll always be at risk of spreading it to others.

**Bonus:** 10 Karma

**Game Effect:** A character may take this quality twice. Once each for Strain II and Strain III. Characters infected by one strain may still carry the other strain. They may not become infected by a strain that they already carry. Exposure to the bodily fluids of a carrier requires a Disease Resistance test (p. 107) for each strain the carrier has. Only one strain will be expressed if the other person becomes infected by a carrier with both strains. In that case, they will express one strain and be a carrier for the other. A carrier of the HMHVV virus suffers a –2 dice pool penalty to all Social tests against people who are aware that they carry the virus. In addition, a character’s Reputation is reduced by 1 for each strain of the virus carried.

# New Critter Powers

## Adaptive Coloration
* **Type:** P  
* **Action:** Minor  
* **Range:** Self  
* **Duration:** Sustained  

Critters with this power are nearly impossible to spot. This power allows critters to achieve this by refracting light around itself. When the critter remains stationary, there is a dice pool penalty of (critter’s Magic × 2) to Perception tests to detect it by sight. If the critter is moving, the penalty drops to only its Magic rating. This makes it difficult to target with a range attack and imparts a –2 penalty to all ranged attacks made against the critter.

This power also assists with the sneakiness of the critter. The critter can roll an Agility + Intuition (2) test. Any net hits over the threshold can be added as a positive dice pool modifier to Sneaking tests.

This power is effective against normal vision, thermographic vision, and electronic vision devices using those same vision modes. It has no effect against non-visual senses such as sonar, radar, scent tracking, or astral perception. Some critters may have a version of this power that affects a wider range of senses that will be noted in the critter’s description.

## Corrosive Secretion
* **Type:** P  
* **Action:** Auto  
* **Range:** Self  
* **Duration:** Always  

This critter secretes a highly caustic substance from its skin. This secretion causes Acid damage (p. 109 SR6) with a damage value of (Magic) P. This damage affects anything or anyone that touches, or is touched by, the critter. The critter is immune to its own secretions.

## Desire Reflection
* **Type:** M  
* **Action:** Major  
* **Range:** LOS  
* **Duration:** Sustained  

This critter finds the greatest desire of a single target within line of sight and creates a full-sensory illusion keyed to that desire in the target’s mind. The critter can appear as part of the illusion at will in a manner that is harmless or pleasing to the target. The critter makes a Magic + Intuition test opposed by the target’s Willpower + Intuition. If any net hits are scored the victim falls for the illusion; otherwise, the target is unaffected.

The victim acts as if the illusory desire was real and right in front of them. However, if the victim is attacked, injured, or otherwise interacted with, they may make another Opposed test with the same dice pools to attempt to break the illusion. If the critter was the source of the attack or interaction, the victim may add +2 dice to their dice pool. Each net hit on this test by the victim reduces the net hits on the original test. If the critter’s net hits are reduced to zero, the victim breaks free of the illusion; otherwise, the victim remains captivated by the illusion.

## Sharpened Natural Weapon
* **Type:** P  
* **Action:** Auto  
* **Range:** Self  
* **Duration:** Always  

Some critters have extra-sharp natural weapons compared to others of their kin. These natural weapons are much more dangerous than the regular weapons of their species.

Choose a natural weapon that the critter has for this power. That weapon gains +1 damage and +2 Attack Rating for each range increment for which the weapon already has Attack Ratings.

In earlier documentation regarding changelings and SURGE, some content bordered on xenophobia and pathological predation.

> What did happen to Elyas, anyway? He just up and vanished a few years ago.  
> Slamm-0!  
> He was put into a cage and sold to some human traffickers, as I understand it.  
> Marko

Today, we have more extensive data compiled by more objective researchers working for better-funded agencies, be they private, corporate, or national. With that in mind, let’s discuss changelings, SURGE, and micro-expressions, starting with a brief history of SURGE.

----

## CHANGELINGS FROM METAGENICS

These expressions are commonly referred to as *metagenics*. Individuals, critters, and flora, regardless of paranormal that possess these expressions—regardless of paranormal or mundane status—are commonly known as changelings. These are a further classification for what we call *metavariants*.

Since 2061 and the passage of Halley’s Comet, the idea of Sudden Unexplained Recessive (or Rapid) Genetic Expression, or SURGE, has been with us. In truth, it had happened occasionally before that year, but corporate media was still unwilling to discuss the phenomenon, as it was one more thing they could not explain. A definition of *metagenesis* can start us off.

The first documented mass occurrences of SURGE took place in 2061, as Halley’s Comet heightened aetheric manifestations, which in turn affected everything from biological matter and


---


# METAGENESIS

**Pronunciation:** [me-tuh-’je-nuh-sis]  
**Definition:**  
1. Alteration in pre-existing genetic expression as normally found in asexual or sexual methods of reproduction in the same or divergent species.  
2. Expression of genomic traits found in all living beings by means of non-tangible stimuli, often requiring the exposure to significant forces found in non-Euclidean (e.g., astral) space.

Beings to mineral deposits—and in a few cases caused tectonic displacements. The effects of the comet were felt for three to four years afterward, although biological lifeform expressions decline within one to two years. The Indian subcontinent hosted some of the more famous SURGE incidents, and events spread east from there. The arrival of shedim spirits made documenting events difficult, but the discovery and use of the Kechibi code helped with data mining.

> * That’s how you’re doing this! Damn, it all suddenly makes so much sense. I’m thick!  
> * Snopes  
> * The beating I got from the code and subsequent rehab ended up having some benefits.  
> * Rikki  

Additional SURGE expressions took place around the globe in locations with significant mana surges. These included: the **Ganges River**, with significant expressions near Varanasi and the Bangla Delta, the **Uluru-Kata Tjuta** preserve in the Australian Outback, the **White and Blue Nile Confluence** at Khartoum, Sudan, **Havasu Falls** of the Pueblo Corporate Council, and the **Nazca Geoglyphs** some four hundred kilometers south of Lima, Peru. The actual number of these SURGE-centric locations is by no means complete.

The term “SURGE” has in some instances replaced more vulgar terms such as “Goblinization,” increasing scientific understanding of the phenomenon while also reducing some of the attached social stigma. Many scholars accept that regional and local influences on the manasphere affect these expressions.

# GAME INFORMATION

## What Grows Back, What Doesn’t

Some metagenic qualities involve parts that stick out in odd or possibly awkward ways, which increases their chances of being somehow cut off. That can leave the gamemaster needing to decide what grows back and what does not.

The basic guideline is that anything keratinous in nature (such as spikes, bones, or hair) can be broken or even snapped off and will recover in time. Any such parts that are lost contain genetic material that can be used as a Material Link (p. 144, *SR6*). The additional costs for recovery from these kinds of incidents is part of the overall changes to Lifestyle costs (p. 178).

## Changelings, SURGE, and Social Injustice

Humans adeptly respond to change by developing new prejudices. After the initial global SURGE, many prejudices, often related to those held against people of various metatypes, grew. Changelings and SURGEd individuals often encounter social stigma and a lack of acceptance. At very least, the reactions to and questions about their more visible qualities can be wearying. The *Prejudiced* quality (p. 78, *SR6*) can be applied to changelings as a whole or to certain metagenic qualities. For example, someone might be *Prejudiced* against all people with Functional Tails, or anyone with spikes or quills. The *Prejudice* quality must apply to visible characteristics; while people may be prejudiced against traits they do not immediately see, that is not covered by the character quality.

## Collectives

Some metagenic qualities are more common in certain parts of the world. These clusters are sometimes called **Collectives**. Many of them have distinctive animistic traits and might be viewed as early expressions of not-yet-fully-identified metvariant expressions. A few reflect cultural and mythological significance.

Changelings are grouped below into regions and types of Collectives they might appear in. The metatype column indicates the predominant metatypes that express each Collective, but these are not absolute restrictions.



---


# Andean and Alpine Changelings

Often found in the European Alps and the South American Andes, monoliths appear to have been shaped and crafted out of stone, and can be up to half a meter taller than their base metatype. Raptors have stumped the world by combining features of condors and harpy eagles. Their wings replace their arms, similar to bats or feathered serpents, leaving thumbs at the wrist joint.

# Aquarian Changelings

These changelings express throughout the major water bodies of the world, predominantly in areas of reduced pollution. Humboldts SURGE in tropical or deep saltwater bodies. Merfolk changelings have appeared in the North American Great Lakes and in the Lake Baikal region of Russia/Yakut.

# Egyptian Changelings

These changelings appear along the entirety of the Nile River basin, including the Blue and White Nile.

# Indus Changelings

These normally take place in the southern Indian subcontinent but have been witnessed in several of the neighboring nations and as far away as the South China Sea. These collectives have names taken from Hindu divinities.

# Dev Deepawali and Changelings

Celebrated on the fifth day of the Hindu month of Kartik (November to December on the Gregorian calendar), what was once a massive celebration especially in the city of Varanasi has become a celebration to the many spirits and beings that are children of the gods. Changelings from not only Indus Collectives but around the planet make the journey to this Holy City on the Ganges River to be part of the many parades, festivals, parties, and pilgrimages. During the peak of the festival, all participating changelings cast off their clothes and fill the streets in a large parade in reverence to the many Hindu deities.

# Metagenic Qualities

## Random Selection

Not all changelings fall neatly into one of the recognized collectives. Many expressions appear to be entirely random. In such instances, roll a D6 to determine whether the quality is positive (odd) or negative (even), then roll a second D6 to determine which category the metagenic trait expresses from.

- **Positive Metagenic Categories:** Animal Pelage, Beneficial Secretions and Spittle, Complex Traits, Dermal Alterations, Metagenic Senses, and Metagenic Morphisms  
- **Negative Metagenic Categories:** Aural Helix Dysmorphia (AHD), Biological Dysmorphia, Metagenic Anomalies, Metagenic Defects, Metagenic Throwbacks, Neuropathic Adjusted States (NAS)

During character creation, a player may choose qualities from the categories listed below, up to a maximum value of 30 points. This takes place in Step Four: Spend Customization Karma in Character Creation (p. 66, *SR6*).

## Positive Metagenic Qualities

### Animal Pelage

A character with this quality develops hair follicles that grow an unusual fur, or pelage, not only having cosmetic traits but other benefits as well. Animal Pelage counts as Unusual Hair (p. 128).

#### Camouflage

**Cost:** 4 Karma  
Covered by dark or patterned fur, the character receives a +1 dice pool modifier for Sneaking tests in any condition with decreased light levels and in environments appropriate to the pattern (stripes in tall grass, spots in a forest or jungle, etc.). Camouflage is incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

#### Insulating Coat

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
This is a thick insulating pelt of fur covering the entire body. Pelts insulate the character from cold and immersion in water, providing a point of situational Edge for Survival Tests in frigid environments (such as Arctic and sub-Arctic regions) and +4 DR vs. Cold-based attacks. Characters must spend 1 extra point of Edge on Edge Boosts and Edge Actions on Survival tests when in extreme heat environments. Clothing and armor can be worn normally over this hair. Insulating Coat is incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

#### Quills

**Cost:** 10 Karma  
These thick, keratin-rich plates resemble porcupine quills, interspersed with bristles among other fur and hair, displacing about one follicle in 100. They are generally shorter than 30 centimeters. They increase the individual’s Defense Rating by +2 in any form of Close Combat. Additionally, when grappling or subduing someone with quills, the attacker must resist damage of DV of 2P, modified by their hits on their attack test. They can also be used offensively with the following stats: Exotic Weapons (Quills) + Agility, DV 3P, AR 6/–/–/–/–, they can be quite effective. The user’s arms, legs, or back must be exposed to gain these benefits. Quills are incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

## Beneficial Secretions and Spittle

Some qualities cause individuals to excrete or secrete substances through the dermal layers or within their physical forms that are of particular benefit to them, above and beyond what the body normally could do.

### Corrosive Spit

**Cost:** 4 Karma (per level)  
Like the Corrosive Spit ability (p. 222, *SR6*) of critters, the individual can make a ranged combat attack, with Exotic Weapon (Spittle), DV 2P per level of attack (maximum 4), AR 4/6/4/–/–. The damage is Chemical, and any damage also inflicts the Corrosive status with a value equal to the quality’s level (p. 52, *SR6*).

### Defensive Secretion

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
The character’s skin exudes a defensive liquid when they are agitated or endangered, like the defensive secretions of frogs. These secretions are acidic, causing a burning sensation or other adverse skin reactions upon touch (gamemaster decision). If someone with unprotected skin touches the bare skin of the agitated character under the right conditions, that person suffers a –1 dice pool modifier for all tests made within the next 24 hours or until treated with a medkit with a successful Biotech (Medicine) (2) test. This quality does not work against spirits. Multiple touches raise the dice pool modifier, but only to a maximum of –4.



---


## GREASY SKIN  
**Cost:** 6 Karma  
The character’s skin contains sweat glands that produce a greasy lubricant in stressful or fatiguing situations, covering the body with an oily film that gives it a moist sheen. While not impairing the character’s normal actions, the lubricant makes the character harder to grapple, increasing their Defense Rating by 4 against grapple attacks if more than half the character’s body is exposed. Greasy Skin is incompatible with extensive body hair or skin modifications or qualities, except Defensive Secretion (see above).

## NATURAL VENOM  
**Cost:** See text  
The character possesses a venom like that found in many species. To determine the cost and effects of the poison, see below.

* **Vector:** Contact (3), Exhaled (3), Injected (1), Spat (5)  
* **Speed:** 1 Turn (3), Immediate (5)  
* **Power:** 2 per level, maximum 4 levels (2 each)  
* **Effect:** Stun (3), Physical (5)  

The Effect always includes Dazed and Poisoned statuses, the latter at a level equal to the power. Whether it’s Stun or Physical damage is determined by the selected effect. The Karma cost of this quality equals the sum of the Vector, Speed, Power and Effect costs.  
**Example:** Vectors: Injected and Spat (6); Speed: 1 Turn (3), Power: 6 (6); Effect: Stun (3); Total Karma cost: 18

* Injected requires Fangs (see below).  
* Contact requires touch attack (Close Combat [Unarmed]) or may be combined with Quills, Frog Tongue, Razor Claws, or Thorns.  
* Spat requires Exotic Weapon (Spittle), AR 5/–/–/–/–.

## COMPLEX TRAITS  
This includes qualities that have not been fully categorized due to their complex, and not fully understood, natures.

### ARCANE ARRESTER  
**Cost:** 8 Karma  
See *Magic Resistance*, p. 72, SR6

# Climate Adaptation

**Cost:** 5 Karma (per level)  
The individual is adapted to better survive in extreme climates (hot or cold; choose one). Each level of this quality grants +1 Edge to all Outdoor (Survival) tests and reduces the Fatigue due to exposure by one level. Advantage in one climate is a disadvantage in the other, raising Edge costs and increasing Fatigue status by the same level. These adaptations are not compatible with implanted dermal plating or skin modifications. If they obtain those augmentations after getting the quality, all effects of the quality are lost, and no Karma is returned to the player.

## Gills

Different types of gills allow the individual to breathe in a different environment than the one they are native to. Typically this means air-breathers can inhale underwater, but sometimes it’s the reverse. This quality can be taken for saltwater or freshwater use. Gills can be located on the neck, in the upper pectoral region, or beneath the arms (upper arms, in the case of a nartaki).

### Gills (Air)

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Individuals with air-breathing gills who otherwise would breathe water use these. They need dense air, so they always suffer a Fatigued I status when breathing air and Fatigued II status at higher elevations and thinner air (gamemaster decision as to where the divide is).

### Gills (Freshwater)

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Individuals with these gills can free-dive in fresh water to a depth equal to (Body x 20) meters.

### Gills (Saltwater)

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Individuals with these gills can free-dive in salt water to a depth of (Body x 20) meters.

## Glamour

**Cost:** 12 Karma  
A character possessing this quality is seen by all sapient beings as moving with an unearthly grace. Their countenance always seems radiant, and their voice has a soul-wrenching, deeply emotional property. Those they speak to feel moved and inspired. This is reflected with a bonus of +1 Edge for all social actions taken that are not aggressive. Those with this quality are particularly memorable, equating to an additional +1 Edge for anyone attempting to make a Memory test to recall the individual or the actions they’ve taken.

## Metagenic <Attribute> Improvement

**Cost:** 15 Karma  
An individual with the Metagenic Attribute Improvement possesses a genetic expression that enhances the genes associated with the development of a certain mental or physical attribute. In game terms, the maximum value for one of the character’s attributes (as listed in the Metatype Attribute Table, p. 64, *SR6*) is raised by 1. This quality may only be taken once per attribute, and it is cumulative with the Exceptional Attribute quality (p. 71, *SR6*).

## Metahuman Traits

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
See *Human-Looking*, p. 72, *SR6*

## Nasty Vibe

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
Individuals with this quality radiate the ultimate bad or even predatory vibe. This sensation is often described as discomforting, menacing, or even oppressive. Grants a bonus point of Edge on all Intimidation tests.

## Photometabolism

**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The individual’s epidermis and follicular development have adapted to include chloroplast organelles that supplement the energy needs of the individual through photosynthesis. This gives the character a –1 LP modifier toward their Necessities costs (p. 179). The character also receives +1 Edge to all Con and Influence tests when in daylight, fully or partially. They suffer a –2 dice pool modifier to those same tests when in deep shadow or darkness. This is incompatible with Nocturnal quality.

## Tough Gut

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Originally listed as “Ogre Stomach,” this quality is an adaptation the entire digestive tract has undergone enabling the individual to process a variety of substances that are considered non-standard. Only organic matter can be processed in this manner, and those with it have a –1 LP modifier applied to their Necessities costs (p. 179). Further-


---


more, they are more resistant to ingested poisons and toxins, gaining +1 Edge on tests to resist. Grants a +1 Edge bonus when resisting any fire-based attacks. Negates the Burning status (p. 51, SR6) from all non-magical sources.

# Dermal Alterations

These dermal expressions are more extreme as a rule than those possessed by normal metahumans and metavariants.

## Bark

**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The character’s skin takes on the appearance of rough tree bark. This quality provides a +2 Defense Rating bonus, cumulative with armor, but increases the cost of all armor and clothing by ten percent.

## Blubber

**Cost:** 3 Karma  
Thick layers of insulating fat and vascularized tissues act as thermal insulation. Grants a +1 Edge bonus when resisting any cold-based attacks or damage. Negates the Chilled status (p. 51, SR6) from all non-magical causes.

## Camouflage

These qualities provide skin pigmentation that adapts to background colors like a chameleon. Incompatible with any other dermal modifications.

### Camouflage (Basic)

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
After five minutes of exposure to a background with sharp contrasts and diverse color patterns, the character’s skin can take one minute to adjust to match this pattern. It can retain this coloration for up to four hours. When they move (more than one meter per turn), they revert to their normal skin pigmentation for as long as they are in motion. While in effect, the camouflage provides a +1 dice pool bonus for all Stealth tests if more than forty percent of their body is exposed. At eighty percent exposure or greater, the bonus is +2.

### Camouflage (Dynamic)

**Cost:** 10 Karma  
Like Basic Camouflage, Dynamic Camouflage alters the skin tone and color according to the background environment and continues to do so. The character receives the same Stealth bonuses as Basic Camouflage, but they keep it if the individual is not moving faster than one-half their walking rate, rounded down.

## Dragon

**Cost:** 3 Karma  
Extensive scaling develops on the individual, which acts to quickly dissipate heat and flame.

## Granite

**Cost:** 15 Karma  
Extensive calcite and keratin formations make the individual’s skin appear greyish and hard as stone. It grants +4 Defense Rating and the Hardened Armor ability (p. 224, SR6) at rating 2. Not cumulative with other worn armors. Incurs a –1 dice pool modifier to fine manipulation of small items.

## Rhino

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Thicker and more durable than Bark dermal alteration, the character’s leather-like skin grants a +3 Defense Rating bonus cumulative with any worn armor.

## Thorns

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
The individual’s skin is covered in sharp protrusions about a centimeter long, resembling extremely hardened plant thorns like those of roses, citrus trees, and bougainvillea. The thorns emerge from a sub-dermal layer and regrow in a few days when cracked or broken. In Close Combat, they increase AR by +1 and allow attacks to do Physical damage instead of Stun. The downside of these keratinous growths is they place the individual in a state of constant discomfort, which inflicts a –1 dice pool modifier to all other physical activities. All clothing worn by the individual must be custom-made, with a cost increase of twenty percent.

# Metagenic Senses

Metagenic alterations can enhance one or more of an individual’s senses. Sense changes linked to extravagant organ deviation (i.e., big ears) from the species baseline are listed individually.

## Broadened Auditory Spectrum

**Cost:** 8 Karma (per type)  
This quality enables the character to hear into the ultrasonic or infrasonic ranges (choose at time of selection; quality may be taken twice). This does not give the ability to choose or control any part of the frequency spectrum in question. As this kind of hearing is always active, noises inaudible to others may sometimes distract or deafen the character. This quality also results in minor visible changes to the size and structure of the outer ear. This quality is incompatible with any implanted cyberears or hearing augmentations except the Hearing Dampener as a standalone implant.

**METAGENIC QUALITIES // EXPRESS YOURSELF**

# BIOSONAR

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
Like a bat or dolphin, the individual possesses all the natural organs for a biological echolocation system. Using ultrasound produced within the larynx, thorax, or even the nasal passages, they can form a mental image of the surrounding space produced by the echoes. With a Minor Action, the character can perceive up to 50 meters in the air, 200 meters in freshwater, and 300 meters in saltwater. If the quality is sustained, they can track a variety of activities in their presence with the use of a Minor Action each combat round. When in use, the power negates the Blindness (p. 51, *SR6*) status at all levels with regards to navigation and combat. At all times the individual may be Deafened (p. 52, *SR6*) when exposed to high-frequency sounds, and they cannot use Edge to resist any effects of those sounds. It is possible to track the user of this quality with appropriate equipment, assuming they are actively emitting ultrasound.

# ELECTROSENSE

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
All critters can to a limited extent sense electrical fields, such as when they are near certain electronic devices, engines, or security systems. This metagenic sense functions at a distance equal to (Body + Intuition) in meters. To use the sense, roll Perception + Intuition and check the hits against the Electrosense Table. This is a passive quality, with no broadcasting noise originating from the individual.  
Individuals with an understanding of electrical technologies, Matrix operations, or similar backgrounds can develop a Knowledge skill called “Technosense,” which allows them to perceive the additional information as detailed on the Electrosense table. Technosense information is displayed after the “/” on the table.

# LOW-LIGHT VISION

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
See p. 72, *SR6*.

# MAGNETOSENSE

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
Like Electrosense, Magnetosense allows an individual to sense changes in nearby magnetic fields. These individuals can feel these magnetic fields, allowing them to detect their presence, direction, and intensity. Finding these requires a Perception + Intuition (3), with a range equal to Body + Intuition in meters. Individuals with this quality also have a strong ability to navigate, giving them a +1 Edge bonus on all Outdoor (Navigation) tests.

# MANASENSE

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
The individual possesses the ability to sense any type of active or passive aetheric (magic) energy, including spell usage, in their vicinity. The individual uses an Astral + Intuition test, using the Detection Spells Results table on p. 134, *SR6*. The range of this sense is (Magic + Intuition) meters, and it can be increased with a simple Willpower test, adding one meter for every hit.

# BALANCE RECEPTOR

**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The quality is an enhancement to various internal organs that regulate an individual’s balance, augmenting this to a more refined and reactive state. This gives the individual a +1 Edge bonus on all Athletics tests except Archery.

# THERMOGRAPHIC VISION

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
See p. 73, *SR6*.

# THERMAL SENSE

**Cost:** 7 Karma  
Individuals with this sensory adaptation can perceive infrared radiation (heat). The range of this sense is (Intuition) meters and is non-visual in nature. Environmental factors can influence this sense, as can barriers or other obstacles. Hits on a Perception + Intuition (2) test reveal information on distance, movement, heat output, and location of infrared rays. It is not fooled by mana-based illusion spells. This quality also reduces the Blinded status by –1.

# UNDERWATER VISION

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
A specially adapted membrane protects the eyes and allows them to function with normal vision while underwater.

----

**EXPRESS YOURSELF // METAGENIC QUALITIES**

# Vomeronasal Gland

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
Individuals develop additional olfactory organelles that augment their sense of smell to levels to rival that of a bloodhound. They also receive expansions to the amygdala and hypothalamus, empowering them to understand the smells they can now detect. These in turn improve not only their sense of smell, but also their ability to discern and react to individuals by scent, including many of the baser emotional responses (attraction, fear, etc.). In game turns, this gives the individual a +1 Edge bonus when making smell-based Perception tests and Social tests when they can smell their target. Strong odors and intense background odors incur the Nauseated status (p. 52, *SR6*) if the individual fails a Body + Willpower (2) test.

# Metagenic Morphisms

Many times, SURGE expressions alter the structural, gross, and obvious bodily form in order to grant benefits to the individual. Morphisms are incompatible with cybernetic modification unless stated otherwise.

## 360 Degree Sight

**Cost:** 5, 10 Karma  
This quality provides the individual with a 360-degree field of vision due to repositioning or compositing of eyes (player’s decision). It could be anything from compound eyes like those found in insects or ocular independence such as that possessed by some lizards. Characters with this quality gain a +1 Edge bonus on all visual Perception and Surprise tests. The base 5 Karma quality does not include an adapted neurological structure to go with the eyes, which is necessary for the otherwise binocular mind to comprehend effectively. Characters face a –1 dice pool modifier to tests while moving faster than their walking speed and suffer a –1 dice pool penalty to all ranged Attack Ratings beyond Close range. They are incapable of receiving augmentations. Individuals with the 10-karma version do not suffer the detractions of the quality and may have augmentations with a cost modifier increase of four hundred percent and an Essence cost increase of one hundred percent.

## Beak, Standard

**Cost:** 9 Karma  
Instead of a mouth and nose, the middle and lower parts of the character’s face are replaced by a beak and nostrils. The beak can vary in size, shape, and function, much like their natural counterparts. The beak is not the only avian quality the character gains. As beaks cannot be used for chewing, characters with beaks swallow each bite whole, and the food is then processed by a gizzard constructed of thick, muscular walls that grind up food. Characters with the Beak quality (including Raptor Beak) also have the Tough Gut benefits (see above).

## Beak, Raptor

**Cost:** 11 Karma  
Where a standard beak is not designed for combat, this beak is. It can be used with the Close Combat [Unarmed] skill, DV 2P, AR 6/–/–/–/–.

## Bicardiac

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
This gives the individual a second heart located in the right half of their torso that augments the work of the normal heart in maintaining the cardiovascular system. They can perform strenuous exercise for longer periods of time and sustain higher pulse rates that would cause tachycardia in normal people, thus reducing any Fatigue status they experience by one level. This is compatible with a synthacardium augmentation (p. 292, *SR6*), but with an additional fifty percent cost increase for both Essence and nuyen.

## Bone Spikes

**Cost:** 10 Karma  
Razor-sharp bone deposits grow from the character’s skeletal structure and poke through the skin. Characters with Bone Spikes cannot wear armor or restrictive clothing due to the inability to retract the spikes back into the body. Armor and clothing can be specially designed for the character and purchased at a fifty percent increase to the base cost. In combat, use the rules for **Spurs**, p. 290, *SR6*.

## Celerity

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
This quality results in a strengthening of the musculature involved in running, causing leg muscles to become ropy and more prominent. The character increases their Walking and Running rates by +3/+6/+1 per hit. Compatible with Satyr Legs.

## Claws

For qualities in this group, the character’s fingernails and toenails harden and lengthen into claws that have various usages.

## Claws (Digging)

**Cost:** 8 Karma  
Providing a +1 dice pool modifier and +1 Edge to all tests involving manual digging or moving.


---


earth, these claws are only marginally beneficial in Close Combat (Unarmed), with DV 1P, AR 4/–/–/–/–.

## CLAWS (RAZOR)  
**Cost:** 8 Karma  
These claws may be used to attack an opponent using the Close Combat (Unarmed) skill, DV 3P, AR 7/–/–/–/–.

## CLAWS (RETRACTABLE)  
**Cost:** 10 Karma  
Retractable claws function as Razor Claws, but they can be retracted and hidden, requiring a Perception + Intuition (2) test to notice. Digging claws cannot be retracted.

## DERMAL DEPOSITS  
**Cost:** 7 Karma  
See Dermal Deposits, p. 71, SR6.

## ELONGATED LIMBS  
**Cost:** 12 Karma  
See Long Reach, p. 72, SR6.

## FANGS  
**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The character’s canine teeth are enlarged and sharpened like a carnivore. The fangs can be used in Close Combat [Unarmed], DV 2P, AR 5/–/–/–/–.

## FROG TONGUE  
**Cost:** 8 Karma  
The individual gains a long, adhesive tongue that extends in a spring-loaded fashion, shooting outward to strike at a target and then retract. Not prehensile enough to use anything as a tool, the tongue is strong enough to snatch an object, provided the weight is less than a quarter kilogram. Because of the tongue’s sticky secretions, the object will stick to the tongue until manually removed (Body + Strength [2]). If the character also possesses the Natural Venom quality (p. 119) the tongue can be used to apply the substance with a successful touch-only melee attack with an Exotic Weapon (Tongue) + Agility attack, AR 8/–/–/–/–.

## FUNCTIONAL TAIL  
In this group of qualities, a tail grows from the base of the character’s spine. It can be scaly (like a lizard), hairy (like a monkey), or hairless (like an opossum’s tail), and it is fully developed and functional. The character’s clothing must accommodate the tail to gain any of the above effects. Sitting in certain positions for long periods of time will be uncomfortable and cause a –1 dice pool modifier to all actions while the character is sitting.

**EXPRESS YOURSELF // METAGENIC QUALITIES**


---


## Functional Tail (Balance)  
**Cost:** 6 Karma  
Usually between one and two meters long, a balance tail is not under the character’s conscious control. It functions instinctively by twitching, swaying, and wrapping around things at random to improve the character’s balance. Characters with a Balance Tail receive +1 Edge for all Athletic tests related to balance, climbing, gymnastics, or jumping.

## Functional Tail (Paddle)  
**Cost:** 6 Karma  
This broad, scaly beaver-like tail can be used to steer and paddle when swimming, granting a +2 dice pool modifier for all Athletics (Swimming) tests.

## Functional Tail (Prehensile)  
**Cost:** 8 Karma  
This functions like the Balance Tail, except the character can control it as if it were an extra limb. The tail can pick up items, though it lacks digits and has difficulty with fine manipulation. Basic tasks that normally do not require tests such as pressing a button or pulling a trigger, need a Body + Agility (3) test for the character to successfully pull off. The tail has an effective Strength equal to half the character’s Strength (round down), but it can hold the character’s entire body weight if they choose to hang from it. Prehensile tails do not provide an extra attack.

## Functional Tail (Thagomizer)  
**Cost:** 10 Karma  
This powerfully muscled prehensile tail ends in an array of dermal spikes and can be used for a melee attack using the Exotic Weapon (Thagomizer) skill, with the following stats: DV 3P, AR 8/–/–/–/–.

## Functional Tail (Whip)  
**Cost:** 10 Karma  
A tail of this nature is usually three meters long and fully prehensile. It stands out for its ability to be used as a Bullwhip, p. 249, *SR6*. It can perform motor skills in the same way as a Prehensile Tail.

## Functional Wings  
Wings have long been something the scientific and mythological worlds have been waiting to find on sapient beings. Wings require the Athletics [Flight] skill and the Magic attribute to utilize properly. When in flight, individuals have a movement rate of 10/40/+3 for type 1 wings and 10/30/+3 for type 2.

### Functional Wings (Type 1)  
**Cost:** 12 Karma  
These wings transform an individual’s arms into wings, with the wrist becoming the mid-joint and the thumb possessing a sharpened claw having DV 1P, AR 4/–/–/–/–. This mid-joint is not as functional as a regular hand, and any physical activity involving the use of hands has all Edge costs increased by 1. The wings are normally feathered, but some expressions are bat-like or even reptilian. Additionally, the individual has an altered skeletal structure and suffers a –2 dice pool modifier to all physical damage resistance tests.

### Functional Wings (Type 2)  
**Cost:** 20 Karma  
These wings endow individuals with an additional set of appendages that form wings sprouting from the lower shoulders and upper back. These wings also have a “thumb” at the mid-joint that is taloned to a greater extent, doing DV 3P, AR 6/–/–/–/– using Close Combat (Unarmed). Unlike the type 1 expression, this version does not alter the bone structure of the individual, which can appear to make them more imposing by comparison.

## Goring Horns  
**Cost:** 6 Karma  
These horns are capable of being used as a weapon with the following stats DV 3P, AR 7/–/–/–/–. If the character’s Strength is 6 or greater, increase the AR by 2.

## Keen-Eared  
**Cost:** 4 Karma  
Due to overly large ears (style up to character), the individual gains +1 Edge when making any hearing tests.

## Larger Tusks  
**Cost:** 6 Karma  
These larger tusks, bigger variants of normal metahuman tusks, resemble the tusks of elephants, warthogs, and walruses. Like Goring Horns (see above), these can be used in Close Combat (Unarmed), DV 2P, AR 6/–/–/–/–. If combined with a Charge Minor (I) action, the DV is increased by +2, as is the AR.

## Marsupial Pouch  
**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The character develops a pocket-like pouch on their chest or abdomen, just like the pouch

----

**METAGENIC QUALITIES // EXPRESS YOURSELF**


---


a kangaroo uses to carry its young. This pouch is equivalent to a Smuggling Compartment (p. 287, SR6).

### Monkey Paws

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
Individuals with this quality possess monkey- or chameleon-like gripping feet with elongated, prehensile toes that enable them to climb more easily when barefoot. This provides a bonus point of Edge to all climbing and gymnastics tests; additionally, movement tests while in zero gravity gain a +2 dice pool bonus. If the individual is wearing shoes that do not accommodate the feet properly, the dice pool modifier is negated.

### Proboscis

**Cost:** 6 Karma  
The individual possesses a prehensile nose or elephantine trunk instead of a typical nose and upper lip. More versatile than a Prehensile Tail (see above), it can be used for small manipulations or even a blunt punch using the Exotic Weapon (Trunk) skill, DV 2S, AR (Agility + Strength)/–/–/–/–. When grasping, use the Strength of the character, with only whole-body muscle augmentations applicable. Fine manipulation of items uses Agility as normal.

### Satyr Legs

**Cost:** 12 Karma  
The individual’s legs are hairy and end in cloven hooves. They grant an additional +1/+2/+1 per meter to the movement rate of the character. They also grant +2 to the AR when used to kick or in combat. Furthermore, they grant a +4 dice pool bonus to all jumping tests.

### Setae

**Cost:** 5 Karma  
Also known as gecko hands, these hairlike structures on the palms and feet allow the character to move along vertical surfaces like many reptilian and insect species. They gain a +2 dice pool bonus to all climbing tests, +4 if their feet are bare. Individuals can hang onto a surface, vertical or even inverted entirely, if they have at least two sets of setae in use.

### Shiva Arms

**Cost:** 8 Karma (per level, maximum 3 levels)  
This metamorphism is found in rare changelings and in nartaki (see *Nartaki*, p. 81). Each level bestows a pair of additional arms, complete with skeletal and muscular support integrated into the torso, increasing the individual’s maximum Body and Strength by one point, and granting an additional Minor Action. Every pair of arms has a dominant hand on the same side of the body. Multiply the cost of Ambidextrous quality (p. 70, *SR6*) by the Shiva Arms level, plus one. Individuals with Shiva Arms increase the cost of any fitted gear (p. 246, *SR6*) by ten percent per level. These individuals cannot make use of unadapted gear, rather than just suffering the –2 dice pool penalty (p. 247, *SR6*). Cyberlimbs had this same cost increase, but an individual with Shiva Arms may have as many cyberlimbs as their new body plan has arms. This increased cost only applies to the cyberlimb itself and not to any additional modifications.

### Webbed Digits

**Cost:** 4 Karma  
The character has webbed fingers and toes like a seal, duck, or frog. This provides a +2 dice pool bonus to all Swimming Tests but inflicts a –1 dice pool modifier to any fine manipulations using the webbed digits.

## Negative Metagenic Qualities

These qualities are the downside of the cool advantages of the positive metagenic qualities. While these qualities are intended to be the dark side of SURGE, they can also be taken by characters looking for a little extra flavor from their character’s background, such as mysterious mutations or the side effects of gene therapies.

### Aural Helix Dysmorphia (AHD)

Also known as irregular cranial or skull configurations, AHD normally manifests as significant physical diversion from standard metahuman structure and appearance. These can be in nearly any form of such, often fitting in with features that are found among other species of the world. The difference in these appearances is they are principally cosmetic for the purposes of game mechanics.

#### Avian

**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
These individuals have had their cranial/aural properties adjusted to appear like those of common avians, including pronounced narrow jaw lines (but not into full beaks), widened or enlarged optical cavities, and similar traits.

#### Canine/Feline

**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
This is a very common trait, with an assortment of canine and feline variations. It provides pronounced jawlines, slight changes to teeth (not enough to use them as weapons), and even shifts in the position of the ears.

# Cephalopod  
**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
This quality provides a dramatic change in appearance, a kraken-like skull including a nacre-like substance instead of bone and soft epidermis, with tiny tentacles that cover the shoulders and upper thoracic region. Skull and upper torso are softer, which imposes a –2 dice pool modifier when resisting damage in this region.

# Pachy (Rhino, Elephant, Hippo)  
**Bonus:** 5 Karma  
Individuals have widened upper aural helices, often with some adjustment to the position of ears. They also display vestigial horns (rhino), proboscis (elephantine), or widened jaws with distally placed teeth (hippo). Appearances are often leathery along the cranial and upper torso.

# Biological Dysmorphia  
The qualities in this category involve direct, physiological, detrimental changes to the individual. All these qualities make it easier to recollect or identify the individual in Memory tests and Matrix searches, granting a +2 dice pool modifier for those tests.

## Asymmetric Deformity (Picasso/Mild)  
**Bonus:** 5 Karma  
The individual body lacks the symmetry of other beings, but on a mild level, usually involving the shape of the face and skull, irregular ears, offset ocular cavities, or nasal prominence. These often negatively influence sensory sensitivity, incurring a –1 dice pool modifier for tests that involve the affected sense.

## Asymmetric Deformity (Quasimodo/Severe)  
**Bonus:** 15 Karma  
This quality covers significant malformation and misalignment of the skeleton or major muscle groups. These directly impact all physical activities, incurring a –2 dice pool modifier.

## Broad Feet  
**Bonus:** 8 Karma  
Possessing wide and flat feet with no discernible arch or exposed heel, individuals with this quality are hindered in Athletics tests relating to climbing, dodging, gymnastics, and sprinting; Edge Actions and Boosts cost 1 point higher than normal. All footwear must be custom-made, increasing cost by twenty-five percent.

## Cyclopean Eye  
**Bonus:** 8 Karma  
The single eye can make hand-eye coordination tests difficult, meaning individuals with this trait cannot gain Edge on actions involving the Athletics test related to objects moving through the air, including throwing weapons tests, avoiding ranged weapon attacks, and attempting to catch anything. The replacement of the Cyclopean Eye with a cybereye negates this quality.

## Third Eye  
**Bonus:** 5 Karma  
The individual has a third eye positioned in the middle of their forehead. The eye is the exact same as the base eye the species possesses in all ways. Even when the eye is closed, an onlooker can still determine its presence with a Perception + Intuition (2) test. Incompatible with Cyclopean Eye.

## Reflective Eyes  
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
The user’s eyes reflect any light directed at them, as often seen with cats, rats, and some reptiles. This makes spotting the individual in at dark or nighttime conditions easier, so any observers get a +1 dice pool bonus on Perception tests.

# Metagenic Anomalies  
These qualities are anomalous, often with no clear reason as to why they take place. Some of these have a significant effect upon the local manasphere the individual currently inhabits.

## Astral Beacon  
**Bonus:** 10 Karma  
See p. 75, *SR6*.

## Astral Hazing  
**Bonus:** See text  
Individuals with this quality have expressed metagenes that catalyze and even feed on their darker emotions and negative feelings, disturbing the ambient mana in their vicinity. The character stands in the middle of a mobile low mana ebb (p. 167, *Street Wyrd*) aspected toward the individual. The radius of this ebb in meters is equal to the Essence + 1 of the individual. The ebb will expand over time, if the individual spends at least ten hours per day in a single location, at a rate of +2 meters per week, with a maximum of +10 meters. For non-Awakened characters, this quality has a bonus of 8 Karma. For Awakened individuals, this quality has a bonus of 15 Karma, and the radius is equal to their Magic attribute.

## Critter Spook  
**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
Something about the character’s presence or smell threatens animals and paranormal critters.

----

**METAGENIC QUALITIES // EXPRESS YOURSELF**


---


Any such creatures within five meters of the individual react with fear and hostility; apply a –2 dice pool modifier to attempts to control, soothe, or pacify them. If drawn into combat, a critter will go out of its way to attack this character first.

### Bioluminescence  
**Bonus:** 5 Karma  
The individual generates light from various parts of their bodies, often with more than sixty percent of the body and hair doing so. The light is too weak to see in normal light; it is only visible in partial light and full darkness. The level of light produced negates up to two hits from any physical illusion that is attempting to obscure them, including Improved Invisibility. In low light conditions or total darkness, the individual can be attacked normally by others, regardless of their vision capabilities. On the good side, the light being emitted is enough to allow others with low light vision to see normally in spaces within five meters of the character.

### Mad Eyes  
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
Also called Bug Eyes or Oni Eyes, this quality makes the eyes seem pronounced and bulbous. The ocular sockets have a shallower development. Irises are either blood red, pumpkin orange, or neon yellow. The eyes are more vulnerable to irritation—increase modifiers for smoke, ash, or other airborne substances by 1.

### Mood Hair  
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
Mood hair changes colors according to the individual’s emotional state, allowing those observing them to make a Judge Intentions test (p. 67, *SR6*) with a +2 dice pool bonus. Mood Hair is incompatible with any hair modification and the Feathers and Scales qualities.

### Striking Skin Pigmentation  
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
The skin of the individual becomes an unusual tone, often resulting in vibrant colors and patterns. The features make the individual stand out more than normal, adding 1 to the dice pool for Matrix Searches. Not compatible with other skin augmentations.

### Symbiosis  
**Bonus:** 10 Karma  
Very similar in nature to the Home Ground quality (p. 72, *SR6*) but with a more sinister potential. In addition to the benefits of having Home Ground, the connection between the individual and the location grows stronger in time, becoming something near-mystical in nature. The health of the individual becomes tied to their territory, waxing and waning as the area grows or declines in social and environmental health.  
In game terms, the individual’s biomechanics reflect that nature. When the neighborhood is healthy, the character feels better, able to shrug off mild depression with ease or face personal fears more directly (+1 dice pool bonus for resisting Manipulation and Illusion spells that attempt to impart these feelings) and even recovering faster (+1 dice pool modifier for all healing and recovery tests, including those involving magic). When the neighborhood is sickly, rundown, or becoming blighted, the individual finds it more difficult to be optimistic, falling prey to their inner demons, becoming slower to recover from mental fatigue and stress (–2 dice pool penalty to all natural and augmented recovery tests and when resisting Illusion or Manipulation spells that prey on these same emotions). More insidiously, the individual finds themselves increasingly resistant to leaving their area, requiring a Composure (3) test to venture beyond their comfort zone. Remaining away from their home for any length of time requires daily Composure tests, with the threshold increasing by +1 for every week away, with failure meaning they will become irritated and emotionally uncertain, registering as a –2 dice pool penalty on any test involving Willpower. Changes in the neighborhood’s social environments, such as disruptive gang activity or a home burning down, result in psychosomatic responses and mood swings; the degree of those is left up to the gamemaster.

### Unusual Hair  
**Bonus:** 2 Karma  
This quality introduces unusual colors, textures, or patterns to an individual’s hair. They may even be entirely covered in a soft, downy fur like the nocturna (p. 78) or hanuman (p. 77). Incompatible with other natural or artificial hair modifications.

## Metagenic Defects  
Different than Throwbacks (see below), Defects are those genetic expressions that are inherently wrong for the individual.

### Impaired  
**Bonus:** 8 Karma per level  
See p. 76, *SR6*.

### Neoteny  
**Bonus:** 10 Karma  
Neotenous individuals retain the physical traits of a child or adolescent, halting their development. Several issues are connected to this condition. The individual’s Physical Condition monitor is at 6 + (half Body, rounded down). Their physical attribute


---


maximums are reduced by 1. They suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to Social tests where (apparent) age is a factor. If they lack a SIN, they cannot prove their age where it may be necessary. Prices for all worn gear, including armor, are increased by ten percent to account for the custom tailoring needed.

### Poor Healer
**Bonus:** 8 Karma  
A Poor Healer is an individual whose biological form simply refuses to heal or recuperate at normal speeds. All recovery times, including from Fatigue, are doubled. Magical healing can occur, but treat the individual as if their Essence attribute is two points lower than it is, to a minimum of zero. All Healing spells incur +1 Drain Value on the caster.

### Progeria
**Bonus:** 10 Karma  
Progeria syndrome is an extremely rare condition in which some aspects of aging are greatly accelerated, thus reducing life expectancy. Though some lifespans have increased due to advances in genetic engineering and biotech, the individual has fewer years to live than others. The only known solution to stopping the syndrome is to become Infected by HMHVV. Progeria affects appearance and is known to create an “ancient child” due to their smaller stature, childlike features, and wrinkled skin. Because of their body’s development problems, they suffer a –2 dice pool penalty to all tests involving one of the four physical attributes, which also reduces their initiative.

### Scent Gland
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
Overactive scent glands produce an overwhelming odor that is difficult to remove from clothes or mask by non-magical means. The scent remains on objects for as long as 24 hours, and makes the individual easier to track. Outdoors (Tracking) tests gain a +1 dice pool bonus and +1 Edge within the first hour of the character’s passing. Individuals who have social interactions with the scent-imbued individual have a +2 dice pool bonus for all Memory and Influence (Instruction) tests to describe them.

### Stubby Arms
**Bonus:** 10 Karma  
Individuals have shorter arms due to skeletal dysplasia from their other metatypical species. In Close Combat, the loss of reach incurs a –1 dice pool penalty to all AR values, including when wielding weapons. The problem further incurs a –1 dice pool modifier to all Athletics, Firearms, Outdoors, and Stealth tests involving the use of arms.

----

## Metagenic Throwbacks
Throwbacks (Atavistic Traits) are effects when SURGE appears to trigger recessive traits in an individual, causing alterations that impede or regress the person’s ability to function normally. Some of these are cosmetic in nature but can bring social challenges. Others of these bring about expressions that can be harmful. All these qualities make it easier to recollect or identify the individual in Memory tests and Matrix searches, granting a +2 dice pool modifier on related tests.

### Cold-Blooded
**Bonus:** 5 Karma  
The individual’s blood runs cold, like that of many reptiles and fish. Their body temperatures are commonly the same as the ambient temperature around them, negating any advantage from thermographic vision. In temperatures below ten degrees Celsius (fifty degrees Fahrenheit), the individual becomes sluggish and loses the ability to regulate their body temperature properly. They are treated as having the Fatigued I status (p. 52, SR6). At temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), they become lethargic and are treated as having Fatigue III (p. 52, SR6). At temperatures below twenty degrees below zero Celsius (minus four Fahrenheit), the individual becomes Stilled (p. 53, SR6), entering a state of hibernation. Individuals with this quality suffer a –2 dice pool penalty on rolls to resist cold-based attacks.

### Feathers
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
All hair on the individual’s body and scalp is replaced with feathers, like those of a chicken or other similarly sized bird. These feathers may be fine and downy (and partially water-resistant, like a duck’s) or fluffy and vibrant, but they do not provide any real value or benefit. Incompatible with Unusual Hair (see above) or Scales (see below).

### Hairless
**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
It’s one thing to be bald, another to be hairless. This individual no longer has any hair or hair follicles anywhere on their body (though skin pores do exist). This affects the entire dermal biome and overall appearance. Sweating is more difficult, and social engagements with metahumans can be awkward. First social encounters with metahumans are done with a –1 dice pool modifier. The individual also shows up more easily on thermographic vision and thermal sensors, giving +1 Edge for Perception tests to see them.

**METAGENIC QUALITIES // EXPRESS YOURSELF**


---


# Insectoid Features

**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
The individual possesses insectoid features, such as compound eyes, chitinous skin, even vestigial wings. These features are cosmetic only; they do not provide any benefits beyond those of a good Halloween costume. Compound eyes do not alter vision significantly, chitin provides no extra defense, and wings don’t bestow flight, or even gliding. The character resembles a hybrid form insect spirit, so they are treated with suspicion or hostility in most social circles. They cannot gain or spend Edge in social situations. Some people may react with hatred and rage, having to make a Composure (4) test to resist attacking the individual (verbally or physically). These modifiers do not apply when encountering any bug spirits or attempting to infiltrate a hive or nest.

# Scales

**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
The individual has scaly skin, like that of a lizard, snake, or fish, which covers at least sixty percent of their body, including the most evident areas with the highest use (hands, face, etc). Normal ongoing renewal of the epidermis can be itchy and irritating, which is obvious to onlookers. Once per month, the individual will literally shed their entire skin, which is a distracting time (it takes twenty-four hours) during which they suffer a –2 dice pool penalty to all actions. The scales appear in a variety of colors and patterns, making them especially memorable to others, though the patterns do not serve any beneficial purpose. Because of this dramatic visual impression of scales, all Matrix searches and visual Perception tests targeting the individual are made at +2. This quality is incompatible with other dermal qualities and dermal augmentations.

# Vestigial Tail

**Bonus:** 4 Karma  
The individual grows a normal or stumpy tail from the base of their spine. It may be scaly, like a lizard; hairy, like a dog or cat; or hairless, like a rat. The tail may betray the mood of the individual when they are experiencing particularly strong emotions such as happiness, depression, or fear. Stifling this outward expression requires a Charisma + Willpower (2) test. This quality is incompatible with Functional Tail (all) and all bioware modifications. Cybernetic replacements can overcome these drawbacks, but only when the quality is also bought off with Karma.

# Neuropathic Adjusted States (NAS)

This final category of negative metagenic qualities are conditions directly associated with the neurological system of the individual that manifest in psychological and parasympathetic manners.

## Berserker

**Bonus:** 8 Karma  
The character has a short fuse. They lack self-control and are prone to fits of mindless, nearly primal rage. They have no control over these fits once they happen, and they are just as likely to strike out violently against friends or innocent bystanders as they are at foes and enemies. When the character takes three or more boxes of Physical or Stun damage, they must make a Composure test (p. 67, SR6) or fly into this rage. While so enraged, they increase all their physical attributes by +1 (not beyond their racial maximums) and reduce all their mental attributes by –1 (to a minimum of 1). These fits of rage last for (1D6 + total current wound modifier) combat rounds. If the individual possesses an adrenaline pump (p. 291, SR6), it activates automatically.

## Neuralgia

**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
The individual suffers intermittent pain along their nerves, occurring most often in the head and face. This pain is intensely distracting when it occurs, and it usually strikes when the individual is at complete rest. Because of this, all natural recovery tests are made with a –2 dice pool modifier.

## Nocturnal

**Bonus:** 8 Karma  
An altered circadian rhythm makes the individual active during the night and asleep during the day. If forced to be active outside their normal hours, they suffer the Confused (2) status (p. 51, SR6). If active in full daylight, all mental attributes are reduced by –1 point.

# PEOPLE OF EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY

This chapter contains a wealth of qualities to give your character individuality and help them stand out from the crowd. It also includes new quality paths to help take your character on a journey as they deal with changes and trials.

## POSITIVE QUALITIES

### AUGMENTATION ACCLIMATION

Your body has adapted particularly well to your augmentations, allowing you to consider further upgrades with reduced Essence cost.

* **Cost:** 2 Karma per level (max 10 levels). You may only take this quality if your Essence is 3 or less.
* **Game Effect:** For each level of this quality, you free up 0.1 Essence for the purpose of additional augmentations. This creates, in essence, an “Essence hole.” It does not increase your actual Essence, but the Essence cost of any new augmentations comes from the Essence hole instead of further reducing your actual Essence.

### BRAVADO

Shadows be damned, you’re meant for the spotlight!

* **Cost:** 6 Karma
* **Game Effect:** Once per session, you may gain a point of Edge for any action you take, provided you show off in the process. Gain +1 to your Heat modifier if you use this.

### CRITTER DOMINATOR

You use your aggression and will to dominate creatures.

* **Cost:** 10 Karma
* **Game Effect:** You may spend a major action to attempt to dominate a non-sapient crit-


---


# Critter Trainer
You are an expert at taming non-sapient animals and critters and train them to follow specific commands.

* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** If a critter is not tamed, you must first tame it. This process requires a week of effort and a successful training test: Influence + Charisma vs. the critter’s Intuition + Willpower. Once a critter has been tamed, you may begin to train it. Each training attempt takes one week and requires another training test, and success allows you to teach the critter a new command. Critters may each learn a maximum number of commands equal to their Logic × 2. For each command, define a trigger and a specific action. The trigger may be a sound, gesture, or some other condition, which the critter must be able to perceive. When the critter receives the command, they perform the intended action. Triggering a critter command requires a Minor Action.

# Cyberjack Maximization
Your grey matter has become accustomed to interface with your cyberjack, which improves its capabilities.

* **Cost:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Add one to the lowest of your cyberjack’s two Matrix attributes.

# Cyborg
You’re an exemplary merge of metahuman and machine. Your body is capable of receiving more augmentations than most people would be able to survive having.

* **Cost:** 5 Karma per level (max 10 levels)  
* **Game Effect:** You may only take this quality if your Essence is 1 or less and you have taken 10 levels of the Augmentation Acclimation quality. Just as with Augmentation Acclimation, you can free up 0.1 Essence per level for the purpose of receiving additional augmentations.

# Discreet Smuggler
You know where to hide things where no one else will find them.

* **Cost:** 7 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** When you take a major action to conceal an item, you gain a point of Edge that must be spent on that test, or it goes away. If the item is no larger than a heavy pistol, its Concealability Threshold increases by 1. This works against normal Perception tests and against scans using sensors.

# Extended Overdrive
You can push your augmentations beyond all normal limits to eke out an extra burst of whatever you need.

* **Cost:** 6 Karma per Level  
* **Game Effect:** When you engage augmentation overdrive (p. 282, SR6), it lasts for one round per level of this quality (instead of a single test). You must include the wild die on every test that uses the boosted attribute.

# Focused Ambition
You are driven to accomplish your goals, and nothing stands in your way for long.

* **Cost:** 6 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Choose a specific goal with the input and approval of your gamemaster. You may always choose to substitute one of your dice with two wild dice on any test made in direct pursuit of your goal. Whenever you succeed at your goal, you may set a new goal. If you give up on one of your goals, you may not select a new one for at least one month.

# Inspire Competence
You know how to motivate people to get the most out of their capabilities.

* **Cost:** 11 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** For a Major Action, you may make an Influence (Leadership) + Charisma test to assist another character on a Teamwork test with any skill. Either you or the character that you assist (player choice) gains a point of Edge.

* You may learn any number of martial arts and techniques during the same training period.

# Maximum Overdrive
If most ’ware goes up to a ten, yours goes to eleven.  
* Cost: 7 Karma  
* Game Effect: When you overdrive your cyberware (p. 282, SR6), gain a point of Edge. If you overstress your augmentation with a glitch or critical glitch, reduce the amount of time your ’ware is affected by one round.

# Many Skills
You aren’t limited to just one maxed-out skill at character creation.  
* Cost: 18 Karma  
* Game Effect: This quality may only be taken at character creation. You may have up to two skills at rank 6.

# Martial Arts Prodigy
You quickly master any martial art you learn.  
* Cost: 14 Karma

# More Machine Than Metahuman
When it comes to repairing your injuries, a screwdriver is a better tool than a bandage.  
* Cost: 5 Karma  
* Game Effect: To take this quality, your Essence must be 2 or lower.  
When first aid is performed on you, the Biotech (Cybertechnology) is used in place of Biotech.

# Muscles
You know how to use your impressive physique to your advantage in social situations.  
* **Cost:** 6 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may substitute Strength for Charisma on a social skill test, but only when you are able to use your imposing physique to your advantage.

# Polyglot
You’ve picked up a knack for languages.  
* **Cost:** 4 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may learn new language skills at a cost of 2 Karma per rank. You may improve language skills for only 1 Karma per rank. You may improve language skills up to rank 4 (native).

They can run, and they can hide, but they won’t get away from you.  
* **Cost:** 6 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Gain a point of Edge when you use the Tracking specialization of the Outdoors skill.

# Rote Alchemist
You are so practiced at alchemy that you are able to do most tasks with extremely reliable results.  
* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** If you buy hits instead of rolling dice when creating an alchemical preparation, you get one hit for every three dice you would normally roll (round down). The opposing dice pool (which is the preparation’s Drain Value) must also then buy hits at one hit for every four dice (round down, minimum 1). If you buy hits on the drain test as well, you get one hit for every three dice (round down).

# Software Optimization
You know how to get the most of your hardware—by running more software!  
* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may run one extra program on any device you own. Gain a point of Edge whenever you use that program.

# Soothing Static
You’ve become used to the noise and find it comforting.  
* **Cost:** 4 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever you are affected by noise, reduce the cost of any Edge boosts or actions by 1 (to a minimum of 1). This only applies to Matrix actions. Noise can be partly reduced, but if it is fully canceled, this quality does not apply.

# Spell Components
You know how to use reagents to power your spells, reducing the risk of drain to you.  
* **Cost:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** When you cast a spell, you may spend a Minor Action to use reagents to assist you on your drain resistance test. Gain an extra die for each reagent spent, with a maximum equal to your ranks in the Enchanting (Alchemy) skill.

# Team Player
You’re part of a team, and you know how to look out for your own.  
* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may spend Edge on others’ behalf on a one-for–one basis. You may combine your own Edge with theirs in order to pay for an Edge boost or action, or pay the entire cost yourself. However, only one Edge boost or action may be used on any one test, regardless of who pays the cost.

# Teflon Coated
Blame just doesn’t seem to stick to you.  
* **Cost:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** If you choose, after the gamemaster rolls to determine Heat at the end of a run, you may force the gamemaster to re-roll the dice. The new result only affects your personal Heat. If multiple runners have this quality, there is only one re-roll allowed that affects all of them.

# Negative Qualities

## All Business
Your sense of professional detachment is reassuring to most clients, but you rarely form close relationships.


---


* **Bonus:** 8 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** None of your contacts may have a Loyalty rating greater than 3. When interacting with a professional client (such as a Mr. Johnson), gain a situational point of Edge on any Influence (Etiquette) tests.

## Bad Back
You have a tendency to throw out your back, sprain your leg, or otherwise impede your mobility when your body suffers strain.  
* **Bonus:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever you suffer from any wound modifiers, you also gain the Hobbled status. The status goes away when the modifiers do.

## Borrowed Time
The Sword of Damocles hangs above your head by the merest thread. Sooner or later—most likely sooner—you are going to die. You’re already past your expiration date. So how are you going to spend your last moments? How will you be remembered?  
* **Bonus:** 25 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You have a condition that is going to inevitably cause your death. This might be a cortex bomb, insidious nanites, a rare disease, or even a contract out on your life. At the beginning of every session (after your Edge refreshes), roll your Body or Willpower (whichever is higher) plus Edge, with a threshold of 1. After every session, increase the threshold by 1. You may use Edge on this test. If you ever fail this test, you will die this session. The very first thing that happens that might be fatal to you … is fatal. Murphy’s Law at its worst. If no event occurs during the session, you will collapse and die at the end of the session. You may choose to burn a point of Edge to avoid your death this time, but unless you buy off this quality, surviving the next session is going to be even more unlikely.

## Bounty
An individual or organization has placed a bounty on your head. Unlike a legal warrant for your arrest, this is an open invitation for professional bounty hunters to collect a big pile of nuyen if they can bring you in alive.  
* **Bonus:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** When your personal Heat is 17 or higher, bounty hunters close in on you. You’re forced to dodge the bounty hunters, always looking over your shoulder, never able to let your guard down. You begin every session with zero Edge in your Edge pool.

## Chronic Pain
You frequently suffer from a condition that flares up sometimes, causing you pain.  
* **Bonus:** 15 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** At the beginning of each session (after your Edge refreshes), roll your Body plus Willpower with a threshold of 3 plus the number of sessions that you have not suffered from your chronic pain. If you fail the test, your pain flares up. Throughout the entire session, you suffer a –1 die penalty on all tests except for damage soak rolls. Drugs, spells, adept powers, and other effects that reduce wound penalties, including pain editors, have no effect on your chronic pain.

## Combat Junkie
You’re always ready to throw down, and you find it difficult to back off when it would be wiser to avoid a fight.  
* **Bonus:** 6 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** When someone attempts to goad you to resort to violence, they gain a point of Edge on their Influence or Con tests against you. You may not gain or spend Edge on any Judge Intentions tests except during combat. Unless you have taken at least 6 boxes of damage, you may not retreat from a combat without suffering a penalty. If you run away from a fight, you may not gain or spend Edge until either you enter combat or the next session begins.

## Cyber Psychosis
Your extensive augmentations have made you something more than just metahuman. In your case, this results in a sense of detachment, occasionally interrupted by bouts of intense and out-of-context emotions.  
* **Bonus:** 8 Karma per level (max level 3)  
* **Game Effect:** You must have an Essence of 1 or less to take this quality. Whenever your Edge pool reaches zero, you begin to lose touch with your situation and surroundings. Either you become detached and listless, or you become filled with an intense emotion that seems to come out of nowhere. Until you regain Edge, you have one less Minor Action per round for every level of this quality.

**PEOPLE OF EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY // NEGATIVE QUALITIES**

# FINESSE
You prefer to accomplish your goals with subtlety, and find brute force tactics unnerving.  
* **Bonus:** 7 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may not gain or spend Edge on any action that would generate a Heat modifier. If you do not personally generate any Heat modifiers, apply –1 to your team’s Heat modifier.

# GEAR ACQUISITION SYNDROME
When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping, or so they say. Well, it’s certainly what *you* say!  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma/level (max level 3)  
* **Game Effect:** You must have at least one skill specialization or expertise to be eligible for this quality. You are driven to purchase at least 1,000 nuyen per level of this quality in gear every month. If you fail to keep up with this, you become anxious or sad. Until you can satisfy your need to shop, you do not gain any bonus ranks from any skill specialization or expertise. The amount you must spend per month doesn’t increase if you fall behind.

# GLITCHY
Unexpected, unlikely, and unfortunate things happen to you on a regular basis.  
* **Bonus:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever you glitch, it counts as a critical glitch, with no hits, regardless of how many hits you may have rolled.

# GOURMAND
You loathe eating food that does not delight your sophisticated palette.  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever you eat food that is not up the standards of a high-level lifestyle, you gain the Nauseated status for one hour. Fast food, Stuffer Shack fare, instant meals, and generally anything that costs less than 20 nuyen per plate will cause you unpleasantness.

# HOODER
You’re driven to do what you can to help others.  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma/level (max level 3)  
* **Game Effect:** You must donate at least 1,000 nuyen per level of this quality every month. The donation cannot go to other members of your team or family members. You may use this nuyen to purchase favors from your contacts or to Work for the People. If you fail to keep up with this, you feel anxious or guilty. Your opposition gains a point of situational Edge on any opposed rolls against you. The unpaid nuyen maxes out at 1,000 nuyen per level and does not accumulate every missed month.

# HUNTED
Someone wants you dead, and they have the means to get it done.  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma per level (max level 5)  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever your personal Heat is 15 or higher, assassins catch up to you. You always seem to manage a narrow escape, but you never get away unscathed. At the beginning of every session (after your Edge pool refreshes), roll Body to resist 7P damage, with +1 DV per level of this quality. You may treat this wound using any available short-term healing (first aid, medkit, heal spell, etc.), but you may not take advantage of any long-term healing before the session begins.

# INDECISIVE
You have trouble making snap decisions.  
* **Bonus:** 11 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You must have four Minor Actions per combat round to take this quality. Unless you have at least 5 points of Edge available, you may not trade Minor Actions to gain another Major Actions.

# INJURY PRONE
Whenever you get hurt, you get hurt bad.  
* **Bonus:** 15 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Whenever you suffer damage from any source, take one extra box of the same type of damage (Physical or Stun).

# KILLER
When it comes to combat, you prefer to kill your enemies, leaving no witnesses or anyone who will later seek revenge.  
* **Bonus:** 4 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You may not gain or spend Edge when using an attack or spell that deals Stun damage.

# Limited Attributes
You haven’t had the resources or opportunities to focus on developing your strengths.  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** This quality may only be taken at, and only applies to, character creation. You may not start with any attributes at your metatype’s maximum. If you are using the Life Path system, you must reduce your maxed-out attribute by 1 and assign that point to any other attribute.

# Limited Skills
You’ve never been motivated to master any specific skill.  
* **Bonus:** 5 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** This quality may only be taken at, and only applies to, character creation. You may not start with any skills at their maximum starting rank. If you are using the Life Path system, you must reduce your maxed-out skill by 1 rank and assign that point to any other skill.

Even though you may have to fight, you prefer not to kill.

# Toxin Susceptibility (specify toxin)
You are particularly susceptible to a common toxin.  
* **Bonus:** 2 Karma

When you are affected by the toxin you are susceptible to, increase the toxin’s Power by +2. You may not gain or spend Edge on any Toxin Resistance tests against the toxin.

* **Bonus:** 10 Karma

* **Bonus:** 5 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You suffer a –1 dice pool penalty on all Composure tests for every initiative dice that you are able to roll.

# Quality Paths
Quality paths are an option that players may choose in order to explore a particular story arc, which is expressed through losing, gaining, and altering qualities. Most quality paths require a specific event or set of circumstances to occur in order to begin them. Quality paths are both a narrative storytelling device and a game mechanic for developing a character through the acquisition and sometimes transformation of qualities.  
Some quality paths allow you to buy off negative qualities, in which case the Karma costs are not doubled. Other times qualities go away through a character’s choices and actions, often replaced by another one.  
The quality paths presented here are just a few possible ideas. We encourage you to work with your gamemaster if you would like to invent a quality path for your character.

## Quality Path: Critter Bond
This path is about forming a relationship with a critter, looking at how that relationship can affect a shadowrunner and their emotions.


---


# Critter Bond: Initial Bond

The path starts when you form a close bond with a single critter. Maybe it’s a stray dog you started to feed and then didn’t go away. Or maybe it’s your trusty horse. Or a devil rat who would hang out in the same sewers you would, and eventually you just kind of accepted each other and got used to being in the same space. Whatever the case, there is a critter that you view as *yours*, and you have grown to care about it.

* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You must have the Critter Trainer (p. 133) quality in order to start this quality path. Once you have taught one of your critters its maximum number of commands, you may choose to form a bond with it. Spend one week bonding with the critter and make a training test. Once the bond is formed, the maximum number of commands the critter may learn is increased by your ranks in Influence. When you spend a Minor Action to command your bonded critter, you may issue up to two commands at once. Whenever your critter takes an action at your command, gain a point of Edge that must be used on the critter’s test, or it is lost. You may also spend your own Edge on the critter’s tests, but only when they are acting on your commands.

As part of this quality, you gain the Dependents quality (p. 75, SR6) at level 1 for a mundane herbivore or omnivore, level 2 for a mundane carnivore, or level 3 for an Awakened or emerged critter.

# Critter Bond: Greater Bond

Bonds tend to deepen over time, and Greater Bond shows a closer relationship between the runner and their animal friend.

* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Once your bonded critter has learned its maximum number of commands (counting the extra ones from your Influence ranks), your bond deepens. You become eligible to spend the Karma cost to deepen the critter bond. Once the Greater Bond has been formed, you are no longer required to use pre-defined commands. You may spend a Minor Action to give your critter any instructions you choose, and it will understand and obey to the best of its abilities. Any Edge actions or boosts you use on behalf of your bonded critter cost fifty percent less Edge (rounded up).

# Critter Bond: Permanent Improvement

The training of a critter can improve what the critter can do, building their skills and capabilities.

* **Cost:** Attribute or skill: 5 x new rating; new or upgraded quality: 2 x Karma cost.  
* **Game Effect:** To gain this quality, spend a month training your critter, followed by a training test. If you succeed, you may spend your own Karma to improve one of the critter’s attributes or skills, or purchase a quality. Any skill or quality must fit the critter’s nature and capabilities. There’s just no teaching barghests to play the saxophone.

# Critter Bond: Lost

Your critter is lost! At some point, the character and their critter might become separated. The critter may wander away, or be taken, or otherwise be separated from the player. The good news is, there’s a chance that they’re still alive, and that you might be able to find them.

**Game Effect:** This quality takes effect when twenty-four hours have passed since the last time the PC saw the critter, and they don’t know where the critter currently is. The separation takes a toll—you are in a bad state and will do whatever you can to recover your best friend. During the time of separation, gain a point of Edge on any direct action that you take in an effort to locate and recover your bonded critter. However, any Edge boosts or actions that aren’t directly part of that effort cost 1 more Edge.

The quality is removed when the critter is reunited with the character.

# Critter Bond: Broken Trust

Sometimes a relationship goes awry, especially when one party pushes the other too hard and ignores important boundaries. This quality takes effect if the PC does something to horribly mistreat their critter (gamemaster discretion as to where that boundary lies).

* **Game Effect:** When the relationship with a critter moves to this quality, your critter will no longer respond to your commands. At the gamemaster’s discretion, it may even attack you or run away.

It’s possible that this broken trust will lead to a permanent severing of the relationship; if you and your critter stay away from each other for more than a month, move on to the Saying Goodbye quality.

If you wish to restore your bond, you must spend at least one week training with your critter and succeed at a training test.

----

QUALITY PATHS // PEOPLE OF EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY


---


However, you may not gain or spend Edge on the training test, and you only get one chance. If you succeed, the bond is restored, and this quality is eliminated.

If you ever trigger this quality again, though, you may not attempt to restore the bond—it is broken forever. You gain the Critter Dominator quality (p. 132) with no expenditure of Karma, but all qualities associated with this path are lost. If you choose to bond another critter, all Karma costs are doubled.

## Critter Bond: Saying Goodbye

At some point, the bond between character and critter ends. Whether it’s death, distance, or some other factor that causes the separation, the connection between the two is permanently severed.

* **Game Effect:** If your bonded critter has been lost for at least a month, you may give up hope and move on. Or, if your bonded critter dies, at least one month must pass before you may attempt to form a new bond with another critter. During this month, you may not gain or spend Edge on Composure tests. The Karma costs for your next critter’s Initial Bond and Greater Bond are reduced by fifty percent (rounded up). Any qualities you had in this path are removed, with no Karma expenditures or rewards.

## Quality Path: Obsession

Shadowrunners, like any other people, may become overly invested in a particular goal or concept. This quality path charts a path through their obsession.

### Obsession: Consumed

One personal goal is the most important thing in the world to you. You can’t stop thinking about it, and every moment spent not working toward that goal is a torment.

* **Bonus:** 15 Karma
* **Game Effect:** Choose a specific goal with your gamemaster’s input and approval. This should be a difficult, costly, or dangerous goal, but it must also be achievable. The goal should generally require three or more sessions to accomplish. You do not receive any bonus Karma for this quality until you accomplish this goal.

Whenever you aren’t actively pursuing your goal, you may not gain or spend Edge on any tests.

If you achieve your goal, move on to Obsession: Fulfilled. If your goal becomes unachievable, or if you choose to give up on it, move on to Obsession: Failed. No additional Karma for the player should be rewarded for activities related to completing the obsession, though other characters who are assisting them may gain Karma.

### Obsession: Fulfilled

You achieved the focus of your obsession, but was it satisfying? Do you feel better now? What are you going to do with the rest of your life, now that you have obtained what you wanted so badly?

* **Game Effect:** Once you achieve the goal of your obsession, you gain the 15 bonus Karma from the Consumed quality. You can stop there and step off the Obsession quality path. Alternately, you may choose to move on to Obsessive Tendencies or Goal-Oriented.

### Obsession: Obsessive Tendencies

Either you got what you wanted and it didn’t make things right, or you failed and don’t know what to do next. Either way, you’re desperate to find a new focus that will bring meaning back to your life.

* **Game Effect:** If this is your first time through this path, you may freely save or spend the bonus Karma from the Compulsion quality. Until you choose a new goal to become obsessed with, you may not gain or spend Edge. Once you have chosen your next goal, you may gain and spend Edge again, but only while you are actively pursuing that goal. The cycle continues, but you gain no further Karma from this quality path. You may gain Karma achieving objectives as your gamemaster sees fit.

### Obsession: Momentous Misfortune

This quality replaces others on this path at a point when your goal has become unattainable. Whether due to cruel fate or your own failings, you have given up all hope of obtaining that with which you were so obsessed. You do not collect any bonus Karma from the Consumed quality. Your self-confidence is crushed. This quality replaces any others on the path you may have had. Your dissatisfaction affects your mindset, so the threshold of any Composure tests you take is increased by 1. You may buy it off for 25 Karma at any time. The path ends here.

### Obsession: Goal-Oriented

You completed your goal, and have developed healthier ways to channel your ambitions. You may purchase the Focused Ambition quality at the discounted cost of 8 Karma (normally it would be twice its normal cost, or 12 Karma), which may come from the bonus Karma for fulfilling your compulsion. The path then ends here.


---


# QUALITY PATH: FAVORED WEAPON

> Note: The Karma costs for this quality path are not doubled, as none of these qualities can be taken at character creation.

## FAVORED WEAPON: AN EXTENSION OF YOURSELF

You have become accustomed to using one special weapon, and it is now a core part of your identity.  
* **Cost:** 10 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** Choose a specific weapon for which you have a related expertise. You must have earned at least 10 Karma in missions where you have had this weapon. Gain +1 die on all skill tests made with the weapon, and all of its Attack Ratings increase by +2 when it is wielded by you.

## FAVORED WEAPON: UNIQUE CUSTOMIZATION

Your weapon is special, but it could become more special. In this step, you make it even more your own.  
* **Cost:** 5 Karma per customization  
* **Game Effect:** With access to an Armorer tool shop, you may improve your favored weapon with an Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (6, 1 week) Extended test. You may customize your weapon up to three times, but the threshold for the Extended test increases to 12 for the second customization, and 18 for the third. The customizations are more related to your own mindset and familiarity with your favored weapon rather than purely technical modifications. They only apply when you are wielding the weapon, and may not be changed once selected. Anyone else using your customized weapon doesn’t receive the bonuses, and may not gain or spend Edge on attacks made with it.

Each time you customize your unique weapon, choose one of the following options:  
* **Kill Streak:** Gain one point of Edge whenever you defeat a target with this weapon.  
* **Sighted In:** Add +2 to this weapon’s Attack Rating at a range category of your choice.  
* **Deadly:** This weapon’s DV is increased by 1.  
* **Extra Modifications (melee):** This weapon may accept up to three modifications.  
* **Extra Accessories (ranged):** Choose a weapon mount location (top, barrel, underbarrel). That mount may support two accessories.  
  * **Defensive Balance (melee):** Gain a point of Edge when you use this weapon for a Block action.  
  * **Offensive Balance (melee):** Whenever you attack with this weapon, you gain an additional Minor Action.  
  * **Wicked Appearance:** Gain a point of Edge when making an Influence (Intimidation) test while openly brandishing your weapon.

> Note: Unless the customization clearly states otherwise, each customization may only be taken once.

## FAVORED WEAPON: UNHEALTHY ATTACHMENT

If you choose, you may take one level of Unique Customization at no Karma cost if you also select the Unhealthy Attachment quality for that weapon.  
* **Game Effect:** When using any weapon that requires the same skill as your favored weapon, you may not gain or spend Edge on attacks.

## FAVORED WEAPON: LOST!

If your favored weapon is lost, you may not replace it for at least one month. If you choose to not favor another weapon, your Unhealthy Attachment quality penalty will apply until you buy it off for 10 Karma. If you choose a new favored weapon, you must transfer your Unhealthy Attachment to it. If you do not have an Unhealthy Attachment, you must take it at this time. There is no Karma cost for choosing a new favored weapon, though all Unique Customizations must be purchased individually.

# QUALITY PATH: VENDETTA

When your Heat level reaches 15 or higher, you may begin this quality path. You must either take Bounty (p. 136) or 2 levels of Hunted (p. 137). You do not initially gain any Karma in return for these qualities.

After the first time you suffer the consequences for Bounty or Hunted, choose one of the following options:

## VENDETTA: LIE LOW

Will you lie low and hope the special attention blows over? If so, your way out is to reduce your personal Heat to zero using whatever methods are available to you. You will suffer the effects of the Bounty or Hunted quality every session until your Heat reaches zero. Once your Heat reaches zero, the Bounty or Hunted quality goes away. You may


---


then purchase one positive quality at its regular Karma cost (instead of double, per usual character advancement costs). The path ends here.

## VENDETTA: SHUT IT DOWN
Do you track down who’s got your number? Finding out who is after you will require the help of your contacts, with a bribe of at least 1,000 nuyen. Once you know who is after you, you must decide whether to try to make a deal, or make them back down. This would likely require the focus of a session or two, rather than the usual shadowrun. If you are attempting to appease your pursuer, you must perform a run for them (for free), or pay them 1,000 nuyen for every point of Heat you have. If you force your pursuer to back down, you must perform a run to gain leverage over them, intimidate them, or take them down. If the run fails, you gain either Bounty or 2 levels of Hunted (whichever you didn’t already have). If you already have both qualities, increase the Hunted quality to level 3. If the run succeeds, your Bounty or Hunted quality goes away, and the personal Heat of every runner involved in the run is reduced by 5. The path ends here.

## VENDETTA: THIS IS FINE …
Do you accept this situation as just part of your new normal? If so, the quality becomes permanent unless you buy it off later for 20 Karma. However, you gain 10 points of Karma that you may use to purchase a single positive quality or buy off one of your negative qualities at its unmodified Karma cost (instead of double). Any Karma not spent on a quality is lost. The path ends here.

## QUALITY PATH: SINNER’S PATH
You may begin this quality path if you took the SINner quality at character creation. If your personal Heat ever reaches 10, you gain the quality Records on File.

### SINNER’S PATH: RECORDS ON FILE
Unfortunately for you, some evidence of your crimes is being collected to create a profile in a criminal database.

* **Game Effect:** Whenever you attempt to use a fake SIN or license, treat the rating as if it were one lower. Whenever you gain Heat, you gain one extra (max +1 heat per session). If your heat ever reaches 17, the authorities have gathered enough information to identify you with your crimes. Your SINner quality becomes a Criminal SIN.

Gain 5 Karma, which you may save or spend as you wish.

### SINNER’S PATH: CRIMINAL SIN
Either your original SIN has been flagged for your criminal acts, or you were issued one after being charged with a crime.

* **Game Effect:** Whenever you use a fake SIN or license, it is much more likely to be identified against your criminal SIN and burned. All of your fake IDs function at half their rating (rounded up), and you may not gain or spend Edge to influence a SIN check. If the Heat roll at the end of a run results in no Heat gained, you gain 1 personal Heat anyway. Records on File does not apply in this instance.

### SINNER’S PATH: INTO THE SHADOWS
Your SIN weighs heavily on you, and so you’re going to need to find a way to disappear into the shadows. This part of the path is initiated by the gamemaster, but it should be in response to the player wanting to finally do something about the mounting pressure.

* **Game Effect:** A fixer or ID manufacturer contact will require 10,000 nuyen plus 1,000 nuyen for every point of personal Heat to arrange for your original identity to be carefully purged from the Matrix. Reduce your personal Heat by half. You may buy off your SINner or Criminal SIN quality for 8 Karma. At any point after this, you may buy off Records on File for 10 Karma. The path ends here.

# WAYS TO PLAY

This chapter offers a wide variety of optional rules that alter or in some cases replace existing rules. These rules can be selected for use as players and gamemasters prefer; even when they are in the same group, they don’t have to all be used together—pick what fits your game!

## EXPANDED EDGE GAINS

Use these rules if you want to encourage more prolific use of Edge.

### FASTER EDGE RESETS

Use this rule to allow characters who gain Edge at faster or slower rates to be on a more even footing with opportunities to use Edge.

This optional rule resets Edge pools back to their starting values at the start of every new scene rather than every new session.

### HIGHER EDGE GAINS

Use this rule to prevent earned Edge from being wasted.

Under this optional rule, the limit on gaining Edge is redefined. Each participant may gain up to 3 Edge per test. The maximum pool size of 7 remains the same.

### EDGE BANKING

Use this rule for another option to prevent earned Edge from being wasted.

Whenever a character receives Edge that would have to be discarded due to a gain cap, that character may send that Edge to a pool called the bank rather than discarding it. That character, or any allies, may spend Edge from that bank by expending an anytime Minor Action. Any banked Edge that remains unspent at the end of a combat round is lost.


---


# STACKING ADVANTAGE

Use this rule to allow strong advantages to generate more Edge than marginal ones.  
When comparing Attack Rating to Defense Rating, this optional rule permits 2 Edge gained for a +8 advantage, rather than only ever gaining 1 Edge no matter how much more than +4 the advantage may be. Even with this rule in play, no more than 2 Edge can ever be earned for comparing AR to DR. This optional rule can be used whenever AR is compared to DR, so this includes hacking and spellcasting, as well as comparing Social Ratings (see p. 50, *Firing Squad*).

# REBALANCED EDGE QUALITIES

Use this rule to reduce the advantages cheap Edge-granting qualities have over more expensive alternatives. This rule is encouraged when Higher Edge Gains or Edge Banking optional rules (see above) are in play, but it can also be used without them.  
When this optional rule is used, any quality that grants Edge and costs less than 8 Karma has the following rules added to their existing effects. Firstly, the scope of when Edge is gained is restricted to skill tests. Secondly, the Edge is lost if not used on that skill test.

# NEW WAYS TO USE EDGE

Use these rules if you would like to tailor the flavor of Edge in the game to be either more granular or more streamlined.

## EDGE AS DICE POOL MODIFICATIONS

Use this rule if players prefer dice pool modifications to represent bonuses or penalties.  
In this optional rule, a player may opt to convert any or all awarded Edge points during an action for +1 die for each point converted, which is applied to the dice pool for the action. Alternately, with the gamemaster’s approval, when an Edge award represents a relative advantage over a hostile party that point of Edge can instead be converted to impose a –1 dice pool penalty on that opposition. Either way, when Edge is converted to a dice pool modification it still counts as an earned point of Edge for tracking the cap on gained Edge.  
Under this rule, Edge Actions can also be paid for via –1 die per Edge cost. Buying Edge Actions in this way still counts as your lone Edge expenditure allowed for a single action.

# STREAMLINED EDGE

Use this rule to facilitate a faster-moving style of action.  
An option for streamlining roleplaying during combat and similar situations is to award Edge based on the gamemaster’s assessment of the situation at large, instead of evaluating the Edge triad (AR vs. DR, gear and qualities, circumstantial advantage) for each and every action. If the runners outclass their opposition in terms of skill, or material or tactical advantage, each member of the team gains 1 or 2 Edge per round. Likewise, if the opposition has the upper hand, the NPCs gain a similar amount of Edge per round. When this optional rule is in play, gamemasters are encouraged to reassess the comparative advantages between the two sides each combat round.

# NEW OPTIONAL EDGE ACTIONS

**Through and Through (APDS, caseless, and standard ammo):** In ballistics, this phrase refers to a bullet passing completely through a target, leaving both entry and exit wounds. This results in the firearm’s DV, including ammo modifications, being increased by half rounded up. Edge cost: Body of the target (APDS reduces this cost by 2, minimum cost of 1).

**Shotgun Choke (shotgun flechette ammo):** When using flechette ammo in a shotgun and firing at targets at Close or Near range, you may widen the choke to perform a BF wide burst (p. 109, *SR6*) that only consumes one shell, even if the shotgun lacks the BF firing mode. Edge cost: 2 (1 for smartguns).

**Silent Takedown (Melee attack):** A staple of covert action is the silent takedown where the protagonist sneaks up behind a nameless sentry and eliminates them with a deft attack, typically by snapping their neck. To perform a Silent Takedown, make a Simple test using the weapon’s relevant Skill + Agility with a threshold of 4. If successful, the target’s condition monitor is completely filled. This Edge action can only target grunts (p. 203, *SR6*) who are within melee reach and are not aware of the attacker’s presence at all; simply being invisible or hidden from view does not necessarily permit a Silent Takedown. Edge cost equals Professional Rating, minimum of 1.

**It’s A Dud! (blast attack):** Whether via manufacturing defect, a mechanical malfunction, or the supernatural intervention by unknown forces, a blast weapon such as a grenade or rocket simply fails to detonate after it is delivered. This Edge boost must be spent immediately after scatter is resolved. The blast effect is canceled. Edge cost: 5.

# New Healing Options

Use these rules to provide options for healing to have a better effect on characters with low essence. Additionally, grittier games can employ some rules to enhance the blood flow, literally.

## First Aid for the Augmented

Use this **rule** to avoid penalizing augmented characters for their diminished Essence when being treated with First Aid and medkit healing (p. 119, *SR6*).

This optional rule presumes that a heavily augmented body has numerous biomedical ports already installed for the purposes of maintaining implants, as well as assuming that damage is proportionally allocated to implants that are more readily repaired than flesh and organs. When performing First Aid or medkit healing, the Biotech skill test can use the Biotechnology or Cybertechnology specialization or expertise. Medkits are able to make use of this rule as if they had these specializations. When doing so, the threshold for the First Aid or medkit healing is (Essence, rounded down). Using First Aid or medkit healing in this way still is limited to one attempt per set of injuries.

## Bioware Heals Naturally

Use this **rule** to prevent bioware augmentations from making the character harder to heal.

Because bioware is living tissue and paid for via Essence, they are considered to now be a natural, or at least natural-ish, part of the body. Under this optional rule, maintain a tally of how much Essence has been spent on bioware augmentations. When being healed (p. 119, *SR6*) subtract this tally from any Essence-derived threshold. Example: a street samurai with 1.0 Essence may have spent 2.5 Essence on cyberware and 2.5 Essence on bioware. Accordingly, when being healed the threshold is normally 5 – 1.0 = 4. Under this optional rule, that computation is instead

$$5 - 1.0 - 2.5 = 1.5,$$

or in effect 1, since 2 hits is 1 hit over the threshold either way!

## Increased Overflow Lethality

Use this **rule** to add an inherent element of mortal danger to overflow damage (p. 121, *SR6*).

Upon suffering any amount of overflow damage that doesn’t immediately kill the character, a death’s door countdown begins, and the character will soon die unless stabilized. Healing at least 1 box of overflow damage by any means stabilizes the character. If the character does not become stabilized before a number of rounds equal to Body, they either die or must avert that death via the Not Dead Yet use of Edge (p. 48, *SR6*). Averting death in this way also counts as stabilization. If, after being stabilized, the character suffers more overflow damage without dying, a new death’s door countdown begins.

## Bleeding

Use this **rule** to represent ongoing damage stemming from serious injuries.

A character gains the bleeding status when suffering more physical damage boxes, after the resistance test, than their Body. Additionally, the gamemaster may apply the bleeding status due to glitches or other misadventures, at their discretion.

**Bleeding:** The bleeding status is usually self-evident in the form of blood loss, but the status also covers internal bleeding that is as equally life threatening as a growing red stain in your clothing! While you are bleeding, you suffer one box of unresisted physical damage at the end of each combat round.

The bleeding status can be removed when the victim receives any healing, or has a trauma patch applied. The status can also be removed via a Biotech + Logic (4, 1 round) extended test. Increase the threshold by 2 if a med kit or first aid kit is not used. This test only removes the status; it does not heal damage nor does it count against the First Aid or Med Kit healing opportunity.

## Lifestyle and Healing

Use this **rule** to have a runner’s lifestyle (p. 57, *SR6*) influence their ability to heal naturally (pp. 120-121, *SR6*), either for good or for ill.

Runners at Low lifestyle are considered to be in the default circumstance with regard to this optional rule. Living better than this grants advantages such as healthier food, better medical supplies, and expanded opportunities for exercise and rehabilitation. While living at Middle lifestyle, runners gain +2 dice, because they are always presumed to have a trained medic watching over them during natural healing in the form of their home’s smart systems (see *Medical Assistance*, p. 120, *SR6*). At High lifestyle, the increased availability of luxurious “real” food, and more extensive medical care adds an additional +2 dice (+4 total) to the healing tests. Runners fortunate enough to benefit from Luxury lifestyle enjoy a grand total of +6 dice to their natural healing tests.

Understandably, runners on the harder side of the socio-economic spectrum have it more challenging when it comes to natural healing. Squatter lifestyle imposes a –1 die penalty to natural heal-


---


ing, due to the increased risks of infection and the dearth of nutrition and medicine. Runners living at Street lifestyle don’t even have reliable shelter, and they suffer –2 dice for natural healing tests. Even worse, at Street lifestyle natural healing is an Extended test with a 1-day interval, so the dice pool shrinks each day until either you’re healed—or you can’t be healed any further.

Runners may also seek care at a hospital or clinic. Since there’s no universal healthcare in the Sixth World, gaining a temporary “hospitalized” lifestyle costs 500 nuyen per day and grants the benefits of Middle lifestyle for the natural healing tests (+2 dice, see above). However, DocWagon contracts (p. 281, SR6) provide a useful and discreet form of health insurance for people like shadowrunners. A basic DocWagon contract covers the cost of hospitalization as described above. A gold contract does the same and also grants +4 dice pool bonus on healing tests for the duration of a stay. A platinum or super-platinum contract grants +6 dice bonus for natural healing while under care.

# Magicians & Mundanes

*Use these rules* to tweak the balance of power between magicians and mundanes, and between some kinds of magic with other kinds of magic.

## Transhumanism

*Use this rule* to afford mundanes the same opportunity for potentially unlimited accumulation of powers that magicians enjoy, via being able to take more and more augmentations.

Under this optional rule, characters may train themselves to accept more body modifications than an untrained mind will incorporate. This process takes a week and is a mundane analogue for becoming an initiate, also measured in grades. The karma cost to become or advance a transhumanist grade is 10 + next grade. A transhumanist gains or expands an Essence hole (see sidebar) by 1.0 Essence with each grade, without having to remove any augmentations. Note that the expanded Essence capacity does not allow the character to take more than two arms, two legs, one head, and one torso (unless they are a metatype that already allows more limbs).

> ### WHY ONLY MUNDANES?
> A longstanding adage in *Shadowrun* is that magic and high technology mix together only poorly, when they mix at all. Transhumanist philosophy seeks to transcend the very nature of what it is to be a metahuman organism. Those who wield magic and Resonance pursue a different kind of goal entirely. As any wise master would say: You cannot achieve enlightenment by trying to walk two paths at once.

> ### ESSENCE HOLES
> Whenever an Essence-costing augmentation is removed, your Essence remains at the same value rather than restoring however much Essence that augmentation cost in the first place. Instead, you establish an “Essence hole” of that same value. When you pay Essence to take augmentations, any Essence cost is always first paid from an existing Essence hole, if you have one.  
> Example: A street samurai with 4.0 Essence has standard-grade wired reflexes 2 but would like to upgrade to a better, alpha-grade wired reflexes 3. When that cyberware is removed, their Essence remains 4.0 but an Essence hole of 2.0 is established. When the alpha-grade wired reflexes 3 is implanted, its 2.4 Essence cost is paid out of the Essence hole first. The remaining 0.4 Essence cost is then paid via the Essence attribute, lowering their current Essence to 3.6.

## Burning Out

*Use this rule* to introduce the concept of an Awakened or Emerged character forever losing the capability to wield magic or Resonance.

As an optional rule you may reintroduce the concept of Burning Out, used in some prior editions, to *Shadowrun, Sixth World*. A magician or technomancer immediately becomes a burnout if their Magic or Resonance ever reaches 0. Burnouts no longer have a Magic or Resonance attribute, nor a maximum Magic or maximum Resonance value, and lose all grades and powers from initiation or submersion. Foci become unbound, and any spirits or sprites are lost, and so on. In all respects, they are henceforth forever a mundane; they may not make use of the Latent Awakening optional rule (see below) if that is in play.

## Latent Awakening

*Use this rule* to allow for an (apparently!) mundane character to realize their magical potential later on in their career or life.

Under this optional rule, a mundane character may Awaken at some point after beginning play, changing status from mundane to either magician or technomancer. The character gains a Magic or Resonance attribute at 0, and a corresponding maximum value equal to current Essence, rounded up. The cost to become an aspected magician after beginning play is 15 Karma. The cost to become any other kind of magician, or a technomancer, is 25 Karma. As with all magicians and technomancers, the newly Awakened/Emerged character may raise their Magic or Resonance attribute via Karma expenditure. If the Burning Out optional rule is in play (see above), they don’t immediately burn out for having 0 in their attribute.

WAYS TO PLAY // MAGICIANS & MUNDANES


---


However, they will still burn out if a subsequent Essence loss would impose a reduction to 0 or lower Magic or Resonance.

## MAGIC CAN'T AFFECT FREE WILL

**Use this rule** to remove the potential for magic to violate personal agency. This may be desirable from some game balance perspectives, but is primarily recommended for addressing potential real-life triggers players might have.  
The in-universe metaphysics of the Sixth World have always held that there are three things that magic may never accomplish: no teleporting, no time travel, and no raising or communicating with the dead. Under this optional rule, there is one more thing magic may never do: affect free will. With this rule in play no magical spell, power, nor effect may compel the actions or thoughts of a sentient being. Spells and powers that do this, such as Control Thoughts, Commanding Voice, etc, are banned.

## THESE AREN'T THE DRONES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

**Use this rule** as a less extreme alternative to the Magic Can’t Affect Free Will optional rule.

> Under this optional rule, the ability to affect free will is conditional: magic can never cause someone to commit or submit to a violent act, nor can free will be affected while the target is witnessing violence.

## SILVER BULLET FOR ADDITIONAL SPIRITY TYPES

Many believe the term “silver bullet” comes from an eighteenth-century account of what was believed to be a werewolf attack in south-central France. A string of murders ended when one of the hunters claimed to have killed the large wolf with blessed silver bullets. The account provided the world with one of the most commonly known weakness for Awakened creatures. Ironically, in the nineteenth century, the term “silver bullet” was used to describe something performing like a magical weapon or an act that promptly resolves a longstanding problem.  
Few things strike more fear into a group of runners than a high-Force spirit materializing in front of them. If a team of runners research the situation before going in, they could have an idea of what they are going to face. All spirits in Shadowrun, Sixth World have weaknesses to some kind of mundane material or effect, thereby granting non-magical ways to bypass spirits’ Immunity to Normal Weapons. Unfortunately, spirits from Street Wyrd were not covered. Consider these additions official, rather than optional!

## SPIRIT DOORWAYS

**Use this rule** to tone down the power of summoned spirits without reducing any of their dice pools.  
This rule establishes a restriction on the Materialization power (p. 225, *SR6*) possessed by spirits. While this optional rule is in play, spirits cannot enter the physical plane just anywhere; they require a space appropriate to their spirit type to form a physical body. This space is referred to by arcane scholars as a spirit doorway.  
Note that this rule does not limit where spirits may be *summoned*, only where they may materialize. Furthermore, spirits can still manifest in the same manner as projecting magicians (see *Astral Projection*, p. 160, *SR6*) without requiring a doorway. While manifested, a spirit can communicate with the physical world as an intangible ghostly figure, but it cannot physically or magically affect anything on the physical plane.  
Once materialized through a doorway, spirits can freely leave that space and travel around on the physical plane just as any metahuman can. Likewise, their purely astral movements do not require spirit doorways. However, once a materialized spirit returns to the astral plane, it must once

again use an appropriate doorway to return to the physical plane. Unless specified otherwise, a spirit doorway must be at least 0.25 square meters per point of Force.

Ally spirits use one of the above doorways at their summoner’s choice. Free, great form, blood, insect, and other spirits that lack the Materialization power are never subject to this optional rule.

# FASTER ALCHEMICAL PREPARATION TIME
Use this rule to encourage characters to create and use more alchemical preparations.  
Under this rule, it only takes five minutes to complete Step 3 (p. 150, *SR6*) of making a preparation.

# ALTERNATE MYSTIC ADEPT
Use this rule to allow players to play a kind of mystic adept that is less of a magical jack of all trades and more focused on adept powers.  
When splitting their starting Magic between Power Points and spells (see p. 66, *SR6*), alternate mystic adepts only receive 0.5 Power Points per point of Magic. However, they also receive 0.5 Power Points every time their Magic increases, both during and after character generation. In exchange for this increased access to Power Points, alternate mystic adepts do not gain access to conjuring or enchanting. Like adepts, they cannot astrally project and can only astrally perceive if they take the appropriate adept power.

# ENHANCED ASPECTED MAGICIANS
Use this rule to enhance the allure of playing an Aspected magician. Below are rules for different types of aspected magicians.

## ENCHANTERS
The magician can create batches of preparations (a number of preparations up to their Magic rating) imbued with the same spell at no additional time cost. All preparations share the same Potency, but each preparation requires a separate test for drain. Any expenditure of reagents is on a per-preparation basis. For example, if you create four Heal preparations and choose to use reagents, you would need to expend eight reagents for full benefit.

## SORCERERS
In addition to the increased number of starting spells, the sorcerer can spend a reagent for a single automatic hit on spellcasting drain tests. This is limited to a single reagent on a test.

# CONJURERS
The conjurer can spend a reagent for a single automatic hit on the conjuring drain test. This is limited to a single reagent on a test.

----

## ENCHANTERS' KNOWN SPELLS DURING CHARACTER GENERATION
Enchanters begin play knowing as many spells as if they were any other spellcasting magician, but of course these spells can only be used for enchanting. That means they have two spells per point of Magic (as determined by their priority selection). This is an official clarification, rather than an optional rule.

----

# MORE SURVIVABLE BLASTS
Use these rules to make blast attacks less deadly.

## COVER SHIELDS BLASTS
Use this rule to allow victims of a blast attack to claim some extra protection from cover.  
Reduce blast DVs by two times the level of cover a character benefits from. This cover must be relative to the blast rather than relative to the attacker’s position. Additionally, if a character has no cover but has the Prone status (p. 53, *SR6*) reduce Close and Near blast DVs by 2. This DV reduction is an extension of this Hit the Dirt action (p. 41, *SR6*) and therefore does not stack with it.

## ALTERNATE AVOID INCOMING ACTION
Use this rule to remedy the problem of not being able to avoid multiple blasts in the same round.  
This optional rule replaces the Avoid Incoming minor action (p. 41, *SR6*) with the following version:

### AVOID INCOMING (A) MINOR ACTION
A character can use this action to get away from an incoming Blast or Gas attack. After scatter is resolved, a character makes a Reaction + Athletics – Dodge Penalty roll (see Dodge Penalty table, p. 311, *SR6*). A character may move up to a number of meters equal to their hits in a direction of their choosing. They may dive to the ground at the end of this movement to gain the Prone status (p. 53, *SR6*). If the character has taken a previous Avoid Incoming, Move, or Sprint action in this combat round, then the movement must be as directly away from the center of the blast as possible, or optionally into the nearest effective cover if the


---


# New Gear Options

Use **these rules** to make some examples of gear more attractive to use.

## Improved APDS

Use **this rule** if you feel APDS ammo should have a stronger overall benefit.  
Under this rule, APDS halves (rounded down) structure ratings (p. 113, *SR6*) as well as the rating of any DV reducing effects a target may have, such as hardened armor. This includes hardened armor gained via Immunity to Normal Weapons (p. 225, *SR6*).

## More Lethal Anti-Vehicular Rockets and Missiles

Use **this rule** to allow anti-vehicular rockets to more reliably knock out targets tougher than a scooter.  
When firing an AV rocket or missile (p. 264, *SR6*), designate exactly one primary target, which must be a barrier, motorcycle-or-larger sized vehicle or drone, or a large critter (10+ Body). If that designated target is in Ground Zero range after scatter is resolved, then that target is considered directly hit and suffers the full force of the shaped charge, resulting in double GZ DV. Any other targets in the blast suffer effects as normal.

## Assault Cannon Blasts

Use **this rule** to grant assault cannons some additional tactical flexibility.  
Under this rule, assault cannon ammunition creates a blast attack (p. 114, *SR6*) with DV GZ 6P, Close 4P, Near —, and Blast 3 m. Assault cannons also gain the ability to also accept standard and APDS ammunition using machine gun pricing. Assault cannons do not make blast attacks when using standard or APDS ammo.

## Suprathyroid Bonuses Stack

Use **this rule** to increase the attractiveness of using this augmentation.  
A suprathyroid gland (p. 292, *SR6*) offers numerous bonuses, including a rare, unconditional bonus to Body. However, it also grants several other bonuses that render the augmentation incompatible with basic combat ’ware such as wired reflexes or muscle augmentation. Under this optional rule, the suprathyroid gland’s bonuses are exempted from all other augmentations’ restrictions on what they cannot stack with. Its bonuses are still subject to the augmented attribute maximum (p. 37, *SR6*).

# New Armor Options

Use **these rules** to allow armor to play a more direct role in mitigating damage.

## Armor Lessens Physical Damage

Use **this rule** to reduce the amount of physical damage suffered.  
When this optional rule is in play, armor converts some Physical damage to Stun. After resisting damage, convert one box of Physical damage to Stun for every 8 full points of DR you have.  
In the case of damage from blast attacks (p. 114, *SR6*) one point of Physical damage is converted to Stun for every 4 full points of DR. This rule is not applied to damage resulting from toxins or statuses. If the More Lethal Anti-Vehicular Rockets and Missiles (see above) optional rule is in play, targets directly hit by an AV weapon cannot benefit from this rule.

## Absorb The Blow ([A] Minor Action)

Use **this rule** to allow characters the option to attempt to use their armor to deflect an attack rather than trying to avoid it outright.  
When defending against a physical or a damage-dealing magical attack, spend this action to roll a number of dice equal to Defense Rating in place of the usual dice pool (typically Reaction + Intuition) and convert one die to a wild die (p. 48, *SR6*). On a glitch, or if the wild die comes up as a 1, the wearer’s armor, a DR-enhancing augmentation, or a piece of gear the gamemaster chooses becomes broken and will need repair before functioning again (see *Build/Repair*, p. 95 *SR6*). While broken, the item contributes no DR nor does it function in any other capacity.


---


# EXPANDED ROLES FOR STRENGTH

Use **these rules** if you want to expand the role of Strength in combat.

## ROLLING STRENGTH INSTEAD OF AGILITY IN CLOSE COMBAT

Use **this rule** to substitute Strength for Agility as the linked attribute on a Close Combat test.  
Close Combat attacks may roll Strength instead of Agility for any unarmed attacks or if the weapon relies on both mass and momentum, such as swords, axes, clubs, etc. When using this optional rule, add Agility to Attack Rating in place of Strength. When relevant to the weapon, it must be wielded in both hands so as to leverage the attacker’s full strength. This does not incur off-hand penalties.

## HIGH STRENGTH ADDS TO DAMAGE

Use **this rule** to expand the bonus for cyberlimb hardening (p. 291, *SR6*) and apply it to all other Close Combat weapons, including otherwise unmodified unarmed damage.  
If your Strength is at least 7, increase your melee DV by 1. If your Strength is 10 or higher, increase your melee DV by 2. Weapons that do not benefit from high strength (e.g., monofilament whips) do not increase DV. The Natural Attack critter power also does not get modified by this rule, but by all means you can roll the critter’s Strength to attack if it’s higher than their Agility (see above).

## HIGH STRENGTH REDUCES RECOIL

Use **this rule** to expand the role of Strength in managing recoil beyond the established minimums to wield heavy weapons.  
Under this optional rule, the AR penalties for firing mode attacks (see pp. 108-109, *SR6*) are lessened by 1 if the attacker’s strength is 7 or higher, and by 2 at 10 strength or higher. In order to benefit from high strength, both hands must be used to control the firearm, even if it could otherwise be used single-handedly. This does not incur off-hand penalties.

# EXPANDED COMBAT OPTIONS

These rules give gamemasters the tools to handle tactics popular with players, adding to what is available in the standard rules.

## OVERWATCH ACTIONS

Use **this rule** to manage delaying actions.  
Under this optional rule, initiative actions may be delayed so that they are performed sometime before your next turn, as if they were anytime actions. Overwatch actions must be clearly defined both in terms of what the triggering conditions are and what the action will be. For example, an overwatch action


---


might be “if they come out through that door, I’ll spray them all with a full auto burst!” or “I’ll delay moving through the door until after my teammate detonates the breaching charge, and I’ll spend an attack action if I see any remaining hostiles after going inside!” The overwatch actions are resolved as anytime actions executed during any character’s turn, so long as the triggering conditions are met.

Overwatch actions take place after the actions of whoever’s turn it actually is. However, with gamemaster discretion, certain overwatch actions may interrupt that character if it makes sense to do so. For example, if a sniper had expressed an overwatch attack on a character who poked their head up out of cover, it is reasonable to resolve that sniper’s shot before that character can duck back down or move into new cover. Overwatch actions do not affect a character’s initiative score. Declared overwatch actions are still valid in the next combat round up until the start of your turn, but remember any actions taken between the start of a combat round and the beginning of your turn do not refresh at the start of your turn.

# Dual Wielding

Use **this rule** to engage in some “rule of cool” and employ two weapons simultaneously on one target.

## Dual Attack ([I] Minor Action)

This action may be used in conjunction with an Attack major action to attack a single opponent with more than one weapon. When combining dissimilar weapons, they both must have an Attack Rating for the target’s range band. When the weapons are dissimilar, add up both skill ranks (including specializations or expertise) and then divide by two, rounded down. This value is used as the skill contribution to the dice pool.

One weapon must be designated the primary weapon, which sets the unmodified AR and DV and damage type for the dual attack. The other weapon contributes +1 AR and +1 DV (of the primary weapon’s same type, P or S, even if they are different) to the dual attack, or +2 DV if that weapon has 5 DV or greater. Blast weapons may not be used in a dual attack. Firing mode attacks that only have one target (see p. 108, *SR6*) may be employed, but increase any AR penalties for the attack by half for *each* weapon using a firing mode attack. Finally, remember that no Edge may be expended on a dual attack unless the character benefits from the Ambidextrous quality (p. 70, *SR6*).

Example: A street samurai wishes to perforate a hostile street ganger with her twin Ares Predator VIs. The base DV for her primary weapon is 3P, but she wishes to cause maximum damage and uses both guns to perform BF narrow bursts, modifying both to 5P, so the total damage code for the dual attack is 7P. However, the recoil is atrocious when only using one hand to control each firearm, and the BF AR penalty is increased from –4 to –6. And since each gun is using a BF burst, that is a combined –12 AR for the given range band added after the +1 AR bonus for adding the second weapon. The combined modification for her dual attack is –11 AR, with an increase to DV 7P.

# Up To Six Minor Actions

Use **this rule** to prevent potential waste of a Minor Action for characters with maximum initiative dice.

Characters are limited to a maximum of five Minor Actions at the beginning of their turn (see p. 107, *SR6*). The potential sixth Minor Action available to characters with 5 initiative dice is still generated at the beginning of the combat round, but if it is not spent as an anytime action prior to the beginning of that character’s turn, it is dropped. Under this optional rule, the cap on Minor Actions at the start of a character’s turn is increased to 6 so that it matches what is generated at the start of the round.

# You Can’t Dodge Bullets

Use **this rule** to provide a more simulationist feel to combat. For best results, this rule should be employed in conjunction with visual aids to represent the relative positions of characters and their opposition, as well as the environment in which combat is taking place.

In standard play, most attacks are Opposed tests that grant a defense test. Under this optional rule, any Opposed test for an attack is instead a Simple test against a threshold. Even though attacks are not considered Opposed tests under this optional rule, the target of the attack may still use Edge Boosts against the attacker’s dice if desired. The minimum threshold for any attack is (0), representing an attack that will not plausibly miss—barring a glitch.

The threshold for an attack begins at (0) if the target has no available dice for the usual defense pool and is increased by one for every 6 full dice in the usual defense pool. Every range band beyond Close adds +1 threshold, capping out at +4 threshold due to Extreme range. Any net hits over the threshold increase base DVs as normal. The following circumstances also modify this threshold:

* **Cover # status:** Increases the threshold by the level.
* **Prone status:** Increases threshold by 1 at Medium and further ranges, reduces threshold by 1 at Close range.



---


* **Counterspell (A) action:** Increases threshold by one half Sorcery (Counterspelling) skill, rounded up, vs spells and spell-like powers.
* **Dodge (A) action:** Increases the threshold for one attack by 1, or at Close range one half Athletics skill, rounded up.
* **Block (A) action:** Increases threshold vs. one melee attack by one half Close Combat skill, rounded up.
* **Take Aim (I) action:** Decrease threshold by 1 at Near and further ranges.
* **Target’s movement is erratic (movement may require expenditure of an additional Minor Action to qualify, at gamemaster discretion):** Double range-based threshold increase. e.g., an erratic target at Medium range adds 4 to the threshold rather than 2.
* **Target is large (car, large drone, doorway, etc):** Decrease threshold by 1.
* **Target is huge (city bus, dracoform, commercial airliner, etc):** Decrease threshold by 2.
* **Target is small (dog or cat, small drone, child, etc):** Increase threshold by 1.
* **Target is tiny (mini drone, pigeon, handheld device, etc):** Increase threshold by 2.
* **Target is miniscule (micro drone, butterfly, RFID tag, etc):** Increase threshold by 3.

# Matrix and Rigging

These rules offer quality-of-life benefits for playing hackers and riggers.

## Alternate Noise

Use this rule if you want noise to have mechanics parallel to those that modify magical activities.

In addition to being less mechanically punitive with dice pool modifiers, this Alternate Noise rule separates spam, poor grid service, and jamming into distinct effects. The effects of spam and poor grid service cannot be experienced at the same time. How are you going to have your commlink blown up by ads when you barely have any bars? Under these optional rules, any noise reduction effects work normally versus jamming or distance-based noise. Every multiple of –2 noise from gear or other effects downgrades the severity of spam or grid service weakness by one category.

- **High Spam:** Areas with an extreme number of people or the height of an aggressive marketing blitz. Examples: sporting events, rock concerts, riots, etc. Personas generated within an area of high spam cannot gain or spend edge on Matrix actions.
- **Medium Spam:** Locations with heavy physical and Matrix traffic sometimes sustain this level of interference. Examples: downtown business cores, arcologies, airports and other busy transportation terminals. Personas generated from devices within an area of medium spam have any Edge costs on Matrix actions or tests increased by +1.
- **Light Spam:** Areas of light spam are places that experience moderately heavy Matrix use. Office parks during the day, nightclubs during the night, shopping malls during business hours, etc. Personas generated from devices within an active area of light spam suffer –1 die on any Matrix actions.
- **Grid Service Void:** This refers to the rare areas in the Sixth World where there is no working Matrix infrastructure whatsoever. Examples include the most remote wildernesses, the ocean floor or outer space, or conflict zones where military forces employ powerful jammers that cut off civilian access to the Matrix. While in a grid service void, no Matrix actions may be attempted unless there is a direct connection established to the target device. Employing a satellite link (p. 168, *SR6*) allows that user to experience a grid service void as if it were an area of weak grid service instead (see below).
- **Intermittent Grid Service:** These are areas where Matrix reception is spotty. Examples include the sprawl barrens and most wild or abandoned areas of significant size. While within these areas, Matrix actions may only target devices within physical line of sight. Employing a satellite link (p. 168, *SR6*) allows that user to experience an area with intermittent grid service as if it were an area of weak grid service instead (see below).
- **Weak Grid Service:** These are the areas where the telecomm providers simply don’t invest heavily. Rural areas away from sprawls, and poor areas within the sprawl (security ratings E through C) typically have weak grid service. When a persona is generated within an area with weak grid service, all Matrix actions it takes suffer a –1 die penalty.
- **Jamming/ECM:** This effect is created by jamming and ECM equipment, as well as certain Matrix actions. Jamming and ECM inflict –1 die to all Matrix actions per level of the effect. Additionally, if the jamming or ECM level is greater than the device rating of any affected equipment, that equipment is unable to contribute to Matrix actions or provide wireless bonuses.

> ### Broad Side of A Barn
>
> Have you ever heard the saying about hitting the broadside of a barn? This optional rule makes it easier for you to actually hit the broadside of a barn than to hit something smaller. When attempting to hit a drone that is micro, mini, or small, or a pixie, the attacker is unable to spend Edge. When attempting to hit anything with Body that is greater or equal to 10, gain a point of Edge. If you are attempting to hit anything with Body that is greater or equal to 15, gain an additional point of Edge. These points of Edge must be spent on that test or they are lost.


---


# Less Punitive Speed Interval Penalties

Use this rule if you want to make operating vehicles and drones simpler.

Under the standard rules, speed interval penalties (p. 199, *SR6*) apply to all vehicle tests. When this optional rule is in play, speed interval penalties only apply to crash tests (p. 200, *SR6*). All other tests involving operating a vehicle do not suffer speed interval penalties.

# Playing the Game

## Practice Makes Perfect

Use this rule to allow shadowrunners to practice dry runs of their plans to sharpen their execution when their hoops are on the line!

Practice requires a reasonable mockup of the anticipated challenge. Building this mockup requires current intelligence on the target as well as an Engineering (Industrial) build/repair test (p. 95, *SR6*). A large space or remote location is also needed. The gamemaster has final say whether the gathered intelligence and training space warrant practicing certain skills. Additionally, with gamemaster’s approval, the practice may be accomplished instead via VR inside a virtual construct. This virtual construct requires the resources available at High lifestyle and uses Electronics (Software) skill for the build/repair test.

Practice requires forty hours of training, which cannot be split up over a period longer than ten consecutive days. When training is completed, each runner participating in training rolls the practiced skill + Willpower. For example, a runner practicing squeezing through a building’s air duct system will roll Athletics (Escaping) + Willpower.

The training works as a preemptive Teamwork test (p. 36, *SR6*) with yourself. That is, any hits on the practice are bonus dice to the activity when subsequently executed. Bonus dice from practice can apply repeatedly to more than one test, but these tests must all apply to overcoming one single obstacle or achieving one task. Naturally, gamemaster discretion dictates the distinction.

Alternatively, Small Unit Tactics maneuvers (p. 86, *Firing Squad*) can be practiced. All runners who undergo this training are considered to have the Small Unit Tactics knowledge skill while executing the practiced maneuver. The average number of hits on the practice test across all participants is added to the leader’s Influence + Logic test for the practiced maneuver.

Training can be directed by a leader, who will roll Influence (Leadership) + Charisma. These hits act as teamwork for any and all teammate’s practice tests. A leader cannot also be practicing while directing others’ practice.

Training benefits last up to five days after completion of training.

## Unrestricted Skill Ranks

Use this rule if you want to play a longer campaign where characters are able to continue gaining skills beyond rank 9.

Under this optional rule, there is no arbitrary limit on how many ranks a character may possess in a skill. Instead, the restriction is how much Karma and time you are willing to spend on advancement. This rule never applies during character generation.

## Expanded Specializations

Use this rule if you want to allow increased flexibility with skill specializations and expertises.

Under this rule, there is no limit on the number of specializations a skill may have. You are not required to purchase an expertise before taking additional specializations. Expertises are still limited to one per skill (see p. 92, *SR6*).

## Twitchy Wires

Use this rule if you want to add a downside to “moving too quickly” in delicate situations.

Initiative-enhancing augmentations leave the beneficiary with noticeable, tell-tale twitches that make them stand out from the less-enhanced. Under this optional rule, any bonus dice to initiative are also penalty dice to social tests, lock picking, and any other tasks involving careful or measured control. Initiative Dice augmentations from sources other than drugs can be deliberately deactivated by spending a Minor Action, allowing the character to avoid twitchy over-compensations caused by hyper-accelerated reflexes. While deactivated, the augmentation grants no bonus or penalty dice until reactivated via another Minor Action.

## Working for the Man/People/Organleggers

Use this if you want to provide shadowrunners additional options for downtime that allow them to convert nuyen to Karma or vice versa.

With this optional rule, a shadowrunner can convert their Karma to nuyen by Working for the Man. In one week of downtime, runners can exchange 1 Karma for 2,000 nuyen (basically, exchanging their energy and expertise for some quick corporate services). Conversely, by Working for the People, in the course of a week they can exchange 2,000 nuyen for 1 Karma (using their cash to help out people on the street, earning them some good vibes, new networks, and other things that can build their skills).

PLAYING THE GAME // WAYS TO PLAY


---


Alternatively, the runners could work for a union of streetdocs or for a magical coven at an adjusted conversion ratio. For instance, the game could include a working for the organleggers where the runner is able to convert up to 3 Karma to nuyen at a rate of 4,000 nuyen per Karma point, but the nuyen can only be used on augmentations.

## DRUG ADDICTIONS

Use this rule if you want to add more concrete guidance concerning addictions instead of simply gaining the quality at gamemaster discretion, and removing it via Karma expenditure.

Addiction tests are made to see if an unaddicted character gains the quality (p. 74, *SR6*) or if an already addicted character’s quality increases in level. Whenever a character takes the second or successive dose within two weeks, an addiction test is required.

An addiction test takes place as soon as the substance wears off. To make an addiction test, the character rolls Body + Willpower vs. the drug’s Power + 1 for each test that was made within the past two weeks. The opposing dice pool always buys hits (p. 36, *SR6*), and a tie is considered a success for the player. Failure results in gaining the Addiction quality to the relevant drug or increasing an existing addiction level by one. While characters have this quality, their lifestyle costs are increased by five percent per level or 100 nuyen per level, whichever is higher. This extra cost covers not just doses of the addicting drug that are consumed, but the entire cost of the benders the character throws while high.

The character has two options for kicking the habit. Option one is to spend Drug Power × 2 days without using and buy off the Negative Quality completely by spending 4 karma per level. Option two is to do this slowly by spending Drug Power days clean and pay 4 Karma to reduce the Addiction by one level.

## OTHER ADDICTIONS

The Sixth World is large and full of vices, and the Addiction quality can absolutely apply to things other than drugs such as BTLs, sex, and gambling. Some addictive activities, such as employing Hot Sim VR or magical foci, are commonly done by certain archetypes in their regular shadowrunning activities. Therefore, the gamemaster may use the addiction test for other substances or activities at their discretion. If the vice in question does not have a Power rating, assume it has Power 5.

## EXPANDED SINS AND LICENSES

Use this if you want to add additional nuance to the SIN and license setup in your campaign.

Under this optional rule, verification systems have a more complex mechanic than rolling 2 × verification system rating against a threshold of (SIN rating). Verification systems of increased capability require supplemental input in the form of biometrics (note that fake SINs are not tailored to your own biometrics). For example, a low-rating fake SIN may incorporate the DNA of a chicken, if it incorporates any DNA data at all. Alternatively, a low-rating fake SIN could simply be a stolen identity of some unfortunate who never got recorded as deceased. Higher-rating fake SINs incorporate biometric data that is plausibly yours, but still comes from another source. It’s probably best if you don’t ask where exactly it comes from. Also note that no fake SIN ever incorporates your real biometrics, because it’s not good if your real fingerprints or DNA that might be found at a crime scene can be tied to a perfectly good fake SIN.

You’ll have to somehow supply the fake biometrics for very secure verification systems. A good fake SIN might have come with a finite supply of these samples, but the amount and the possibility of sample re-supply is a matter reserved for gamemaster discretion.

If the fake SIN is purchasing an item requiring a license, passes a security checkpoint, or is scanned by any verification system a verification check is performed. There is a chance that the verification system may catch something. At that time, the character must make an Opposed test pitting the fake ID rating against the verification system dice pool equal to its rating. The side with the most hits wins. The verification system wins if it’s a tie.

If the verification system is rating 5 or higher, a Stealth (Palming) + Agility vs. operator’s Perception + Intuition Opposed test is necessary to slip any fake samples that match the fake SIN into the reader. If the verification test is a tie, the system prompts the operator to query the character for clarifying information. You must succeed on a Con + Charisma (Verification Rating) to clear the query and pass the SIN verification.

## Building a SIN

Where does a SIN come from? The answer is simpler than the actual item in question. A nation or an extraterritorial corporation with an AA or AAA rating will issue a SIN when a person becomes a citizen. Historically, this takes place at birth if the person is born “legally” in that country or corporation complex. The SIN is created by feeding genetic information into an incredibly complicated mathematical algorithm to generate a unique string of characters. Because a SIN’s foundation is the person’s own genetic material, it guarantees no two SINs are ever the same. Additionally, anyone with a high-level verification system can have access to not only your name, birth date, place of birth, and SIN issuer, they could also have access to blood type, fingerprints, retinal scans, and DNA. To protect it, all this information is stored in two locations: the country or corporation that issued the SIN and the Global SIN Registry (GSINR). The GSINR is under the watchful eye of the Corporate Court.

Finding a good ID manufacturer is about more than just grabbing any old ID. A high-quality fake SIN is the equivalent of creating a whole new person, including medical records, education, credit history, normal licenses, and biometrics. It’s a monumental task. Once you get past that, you are going to need the right biometric material if you are going to bypass security checkpoints with that SIN. Does that checkpoint require DNA? Better make sure that you have a way to be able to pass off the fake material. Does the checkpoint just do facial recognition? A good make-up kit might work, but you might be better off wearing a mask in an effort to persuade the guards you are ill and don’t want to sicken others.

## Alternate SIN Qualities

Use these rules to add nuance and flavor to the different kinds of SINs.

* **National SINner quality (8 karma):** As per SINner quality (p. 78, SR6).

* **Corporate SINner quality (8 karma):** Corporate SINners are the Sixth World’s analogue for royalty; only the most trusted and elite corporate officers are granted supranational citizenship. However, your intrinsic tie to “Big Brother” renders you untrustworthy in the shadows, where you are viewed as a sellout or worse. This quality has the same rules as the SINner quality but adds this feature: When interacting with any members of the shadow community, your reputation is treated as being 10 points lower than it truly is. On the upside, your above-the-law connections grant you bonus Edge when acquiring gear (see p. 244, *SR6*).

* **Criminal SINner quality (8 Karma):** These unfortunates have been convicted of a serious crime and have been stripped of many civil rights as a consequence. It is difficult for criminal SINners to find legal work, and in the eyes of the law they are always the first to be suspected of any wrongdoings. In addition to the usual rules for SINners, when interacting with law enforcement or law-abiding members of the Sixth World, your reputation is treated as being 10 points lower than it truly is. This includes checks to see if Heat increases (p. 236, *SR6*). If this quality is taken during character generation, gain an additional 3 points to spend on contacts’ Connection and Loyalty to represent the chummers you made while incarcerated.

* **The Panopticon Rule:** Because it’s impossible to completely erase your biometrics from every place you go or every sensor that police might review the records of, having those biometrics on file makes staying anonymous inherently more challenging than it does for the SINless. No matter what SINner quality you have, you suffer a +1 modifier when checking to see if Heat increases.

* **Buying off any SINner quality:** This involves more than just faking your death, since the SINs and biometrics of the deceased are supposed to be retained indefinitely. Removing a SIN from the system once it’s been established requires assets beyond the scope of shadowrunners. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a character may buy off a National or Corporate SIN for 3 x Karma cost. Removing a criminal SIN requires 4 x Karma cost. This expenditure represents serious and numerous favors being expended on behalf of organizations or individuals. Thank-yous back to the recruiters will be expected.

## Not Available Here

Use this rule if you want to adjust how easy or challenging it is to find items in your campaign. While you can adjust the Availability ratings, change what requires a license or what is illegal, or modify the time it takes to get gear, this specifically makes it easier to buy things legally and makes it harder to buy off the record.

PLAYING THE GAME // WAYS TO PLAY


---


Buying gear on the Matrix is easy. Runners can just login to a retail Matrix host, put in their SIN with licenses, and find pretty much any gear. Once the order has been placed, the delivery is on its way from the nearest fulfillment center. For anything that is legal to buy, it takes days equal to the Availability rating to deliver through standard shipping. If the runners need it quicker, there is expedited shipping—for ten percent of the price of the goods, shipping time is reduced by two days. For items that require a license, roll the license rating as an Opposed test against the Availability rating. Failing the license check results in an error and your account being put on temporary hold for seven days. If the gear is subsequently linked to a crime scene, that license and SIN are burned.

Buying illegal gear, gear that you don’t have a license for, or just gear that you don’t want registered with the authorities requires the use of an appropriate contact who’s going to charge a finder’s fee of ten percent. The contact will only find gear where Availability rating is less than or equal to their Connection rating. The contact will only sell the gear to the runner if their Loyalty rating is greater than or equal to the gear’s Availability rating. Otherwise, getting the gear requires finding it through a Matrix Search, going on a run to steal the gear, and then smuggling it back to your local region.

# Soirees And Socialites

## Opposed Social Skills

Use this rule if you want to allow the defending party to use their skill instead of just their attributes. Using the Con and Influence skills normally involves a resistance test built from two attributes, usually Willpower + Intuition. Unfortunately for con artists, hagglers, and interrogators, one’s skill at using Con and Influence ends up having no bearing when being conned or influenced.

This optional rule allows for the target of a Con or Influence test to replace one of their attributes with the rank they possess in either skill, including any applicable specialization or expertise. For example: The team’s face wishes to negotiate with Mr. Johnson for higher pay. Mr. Johnson has Influence 5 (Negotiation +2), Logic 3, and Willpower 4. Rather than rolling Logic 3 + Willpower 4 against the face’s pool, he may instead substitute Influence and the Negotiation specialization in for Logic, resulting in a resistance pool with 11 dice rather than 7.

## Point And Counterpoint

Use this rule if you want to emphasize the use of Willpower during social encounters. With this optional rule, every social encounter consists of two Opposed tests. The attacking group performs a normal Influence or Con test that is opposed by the normal defense test (p. 94 and 96, SR6). The other party then has the opportunity to make a counterpoint against the attacking group using their Con or Influence. For example, if the shadowrunners are attempting to get the passcode from a corporate wageslave, they could use Influence (Intimidation) to get that data from the worker. The worker can then attempt to either Con the team or maybe negotiate to get paid for the information. Net hits are tracked for both tests, and the difference between the two sets of net hits is the final number of hits for the winning party.

## The Social Condition (Monitor)

Use this rule if you want to expand social encounters to mimic the experience of a combat encounter. Each side has Condition Monitors and initiative, and they take actions to attempt to win the negotiation, handle a tough interrogation, or simply con a mark out of a few thousand nuyen. Each character gains a new Condition Monitor in addition to tracking of Physical and Stun tracks. The Social Condition Monitor has (Willpower/2, rounded up) + 8 boxes, which is the same as the Stun Condition Monitor. When each row of boxes on a monitor is filled, the character takes a –1 dice pool penalty to all Social tests. When a character’s Social Condition Monitor is completely filled, they are no longer able to contribute to social tests until they recover.

Initiative for social encounters is not impacted by augmentations such as wired reflexes or magical augmentations. It’s instead controlled by your speed of thought and communication. For physical meets, characters roll initiative of Logic + Intuition + 1D6. For Matrix or astral meets, roll initiative per normal Matrix or astral initiative rules (p. 161, 179, SR6). The length of time that a round takes for a physical social encounter is longer than combat rounds. The default length of a social round is one minute, but feel free to modify this based on the situation.

As they enter the witty repartee of a social encounter, the attacker and defender both have stated objectives. This could be anything from getting the drug dealer to give up their supplier, getting Mr. Johnson to pay extra, or conning a group of runners into thinking you don’t know anything. The attacking group performs a normal Influence or Con test that is opposed by the normal defense test (p. 94 and 96, SR6). Grunts add their Professional


---


Rating to the defense test representing the backing of their larger organization. The base damage for Social attacks is 2; whichever side got more hits adds their net hits and inflicts that much damage. If there is a tie on the test, both sides must resist 2 points of Social damage to represent the intellectual wear and tear of the debate. The defender can reduce this damage with a Willpower test, eliminating one point of damage for each hit.

The war of words can be done in one of two ways. The first method is to treat both sides as a grunt group (p. 114, SR6) with each side having a single leader. Each team uses a single Social Condition Monitor that matches the leader and uses that leader’s defense rolls, but the attack gains the benefit of +1 die per assisting team member. The second method is similar in that each side has a single leader, but instead of using grunt group rules, other members of the team that are taking part use the Assist Major Action (p. 42, SR6). In either method, the leader of the encounter cannot change once combat begins.

Characters can concede defeat at any point in the social situation. The losing side bends to the view of the winning side of the argument. For a con, either the victim believes the con and buys in, or the person attempting to con another party gives up. For negotiation, the attacking side decides that the results are as good as they are going to get. For intimidation, the defender agrees to spill the beans or do what is requested. Just be aware that there are boundaries that characters won’t necessarily cross. You succeeded in intimidating someone, but if your goal is for them to murder someone, they could still refuse. You may be able to seduce the corporate manager, but they may not hand over the department finances.

Once the encounter is resolved, either because one side has exhausted their Social Condition Monitor or retreated, the final results are based on the differences between damage taken. For example, during a negotiation with Mr. Johnson and after multiple rounds of arguments results in the runner having taken 4 boxes of Social damage, while Mr. Johnson has taken 8 boxes. This results in the runners having 4 net hits on the encounter.

Recovery from a rigorous debate is often quick and easy. If a character has any remaining unfilled boxes on their Social Condition Monitor, upon exiting from the situation, they are automatically healed up to full. Exiting the situation means moving away from their previous opponent and moving on to the next scene or section of the adventure. If the character has filled their Social Condition Monitor, the amount of mental stress continues on past the current scene or situation and will impact that runner on all Social tests until they have at least eight hours of downtime.

# Example of a Social Encounter

A team of runners is attempting to get Spanky the bliss dealer to give up who his supplier is. The leader of the runner team is Teller. Spanky has a Social Condition Monitor of 9 boxes, and Teller has 10 boxes.

**Skills:** Con 3, Influence 3

Both sides roll their Social Initiative—Teller gets 9, and Spanky gets 8. Teller decides to start out by trying to con the dealer into giving up the information. Teller rolls his Con (Acting) + Charisma + 3 dice from grunt group bonus from his team vs. Spanky’s Intuition + Willpower + Professional Rating, where Teller gets 6 hits against Spanky’s 3 hits. Spanky has 5 points of incoming social damage (base of 2 + 3 net hits). Spanky rolls 2 dice for his Willpower, getting 1 hit, resulting in him taking 4 damage to his Social Condition Monitor. Spanky is starting to buy into the pitch, but he feels like he wants in on the cut. He decides to Con Teller and the team, rolling his Con + Charisma – Wound Penalties vs. Teller’s Intuition + Willpower. Spanky gets 3 hits and Teller gets 2 hits, resulting in Teller attempting to soak 3 social damage using his Willpower and taking 1 damage.

In the second round, Teller decides to switch up strategies and try to intimidate the dealer into giving up his supplier. Teller rolls his Influence + Charisma – Wound Penalty + 3 dice from his team vs Spanky’s Intuition + Willpower + Professional Rating – Wound Penalty resulting in Spanky needing to soak 3 social damage and him taking 2 damage. Spanky starts to realize that things are not going his way and decides it’s time to use etiquette as a way to save some face by using Influence + Logic – Wound Penalties vs. Teller’s Logic + Willpower. Even though Spanky finally targeted Teller’s weak spot, his social capital has been expended, and he doesn’t hit Teller. Rather than continue to lose further, he agrees to tell the team what he knows and end the social encounter.

# Social Disposition

Use this rule if you want to provide the character the ability to sway an NPC before attempting an Influence or Con test. An optional attack in Social Combat or as an Influence Simple test can be done in an attempt to change their opinion instead of doing any sort of attack against their Social Condition Monitor. Success on the attack improves the NPC’s disposition by one category.

# Negative Qualities

There are a number of negative qualities where the effect doesn’t occur on every run. Qualities such as allergy, compulsion, phobia, and others that have a periodic nature to them result in a lower Karma bonus for less frequently occurring levels. Often the effect has a severity along with the frequency of occurrence. For frequency, the suggestion is to have a range from 2 to 12 Karma. This means having a bonus of 2 Karma per level with the time intervals being the same as Addiction Withdrawal Table (p. 74, SR6) or 3 Karma per level with commonality the same as the Allergy Table (p. 75, SR6). For severity and penalties, see the list below.

Other negative qualities only occur on the result of a specific roll, like the Gremlins quality. In the case of this quality, the player rolls 2D6 and ...

## Examples of Building Your Own Qualities

### Tactical Genius  
You have studied at top military colleges. You have served in various theaters of war and led your team using smart tactics.  
* **Cost:** 5 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You gain a point of temporary Edge when making tests for Small Unit Tactics.

### Natural Born Follower  
When it comes to taking charge, you are fast to point to literally anyone else. This has caused issues where you change your mind based on the last thing anyone else has said.

* **Bonus:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You cannot spend Edge on any Social test unless you succeed at a Willpower + Logic (3) test. In addition, during combat your initiative is treated as half its result (rounded down) during the first round.

### Logical Problem Solver  
You are a master problem solver. You can analyze information to help deduce solutions, while separating useful bits from the distractions and noise.  
* **Cost:** 12 Karma  
* **Game Effect:** You gain a bonus Edge when you make any Logic-based test.

# Wild Die Extra Actions

Use these optional actions if you want to add more ways that the wild die can be used in your game. The wild die mechanic adds more variability to the outcome of risky actions.

## Reckless Tactics  
*(Minor Action)*  
Sometimes you want to take a gamble when you roll the dice. Maybe you are heading into a negotiation and you have an ace argument, but it’s based on a bit of an exaggerated risk. Maybe you’re firing your gun from the hip. It might just give you the edge, but it could also fail spectacularly. By spending a Minor Action, the runner can add a wild die to their next test.

## Spell Adjustments  
On any spell adjustment (Amp Up, Increase Area), you may try to squeeze a little extra out of the spell—but that effort could backfire on you. By spending a Minor Action, the runner can add a wild die when rolling their Sorcery test.

## Untrained Skill Tests  
Sometimes, even when you don’t know what you’re doing, you can luck into a nice success—or unexpected disaster. By spending a Minor Action, the runner can add a wild die when rolling an untrained skill test.

# (META)HUMAN RESOURCES

There’s an old saying in the shadows: “you are who you know.” Every runner is only as good as their contacts. This chapter looks at a few new ways to use contacts. Contacts may have all sorts of useful information, provide off-the-books services, and are a source for all types of untraceable—and often illegal—gear. This chapter expands on the material presented in *Shadowrun, Sixth World* with some new information on existing contacts, a roster of new contacts, and expanded rules for using contacts.

## CONTACT TYPES

In addition to Loyalty and Connection Ratings (p. 50, SR6), contacts have a type, or sometimes two, that determines what gear, services, and information they have the easiest access to. Contacts are sorted into the following types: Academic, Corporate, Criminal, Engineering, Government, Magic, Matrix, Media, Medical, and Street. Every runner knows that you don’t ask a talismonger to run down cyberware for you; that’s a job for a good street doc. It’s the same thing when you’re digging for dirt on a local A-Corp CEO. You won’t get much by asking a gang leader out in the barrens, but you can bet that a lot of corporate secretaries will be current with all the local gossip.

* **Academic:** Includes all sorts of instructors, researchers, and intellectuals, as well as professionals like lawyers and accountants. Typically, you call on this type of contact to see what they know, not necessarily what they can do—unless you need a lawyer.

* **Corporate:** These may be employees of one of the Big Ten, or they could work for a smaller local corporation. Either way, they will have the scoop on the corporate world. In addition to information, this type of contact may have access to a pipeline for grey-market products, or they might be able to provide certain corporate services.

**(META)HUMAN RESOURCES // CONTACT TYPES**


---


* **Criminal:** They could be Mafia, Triad, Yakuza, Vory or even the larger nationwide gangs—their connection to a criminal organization separates this contact from common street criminals. Criminal types can be a good source for black-market goods as well as information on their competitors.

* **Engineering:** This type covers anyone who works with or operates vehicles or drones as well as other applied mechanical technologies. Chop-shop mechanics, taxi drivers, drone dealers, VTOL/LAV pilots, and junkyard operators fall into this type, along with locksmiths, construction workers, and even demolition experts. This is who you call to get a ride, buy a new machine, get something built, install some mods, have some repairs done, or even blow something up.

* **Government:** While police and city services are all run by corporations these days, they still count as working for the government, as do the military and actual government employees. Government contacts are uniquely positioned to reduce the amount of heat on a team and provide info about what’s on their record—or anyone else’s record.

* **Magic:** Arcanists, talismongers, enchanters plus anyone else providing a magical service are in this type. This is who can get your reagents, alchemical preps, foci and spell formulas. This type also includes contacts that are only made possible by magic—free spirits, shapeshifters, ghouls, and other Infected.

* **Matrix:** Deckmeisters, techs, programmers, sysops of the various shadow BBSs, and the bartender at your favorite matrix nightclub all fall into Matrix contacts. They can pass along the latest in Matrix gossip as well as being a source of the hottest tech.

* **Media:** Not just news reporters, editors, and pirate media broadcasters, but everyone that makes a living in the spotlight such as athletes, rockers, and sim-stars are in this category. Typically, they are called on for what they know or what they can find out.

* **Medical:** Paramedics, street docs, pharmacy workers and cyber-surgeons are who you call when you need medical services or you’re looking for some new ’ware.

* **Street:** All sorts of SINless living on the fringe of society fall into this group. Smugglers, gangers, coyotes, drug dealers, hustlers, petty criminals, squatters, prostitutes and other down-and-outs, including most of the other shadowrunners that you know.

# Expanded Rules for Contacts at Character Creation

Instead of a flat limit of Charisma for a contact’s Loyalty and Connection rating at character creation, use the following rules. Group Contacts have their own rules outlined below; these expanded rules do not apply to Group Contacts.

* The initial pool of (6 × Charisma) points used for contact Loyalty rating and Connection rating may be increased at a cost of 1 point of Karma spent per 1 point of increase.

* The hard limit for Loyalty and Connection ratings is 8 at character creation; neither can be higher, regardless of points available.

* Characters may move points from the Charisma limit between the Loyalty rating and Connection rating so that the soft limit becomes Loyalty + Connection = 2 × Charisma. This does not change the hard limit of 8 for either Loyalty or Connection.

* This soft cap can be increased by 1 point per 1 point of Karma spent. This does not change the hard limit of 8 for either Loyalty or Connection.

* In addition to determining the Loyalty and Connection ratings, the contact must also be assigned a type. A contact may be given two types; this gives them a broader range of gear and information to draw from, while also making them less focused and slightly less effective.

As an example, a character with 4 Charisma has 24 points to be used for their contacts Loyalty and Connection. Spending 2 Karma would increase this to 26. A single contact has a soft cap of 8 points (Charisma × 2), meaning Loyalty plus Connection have a maximum of 8 points. Possible splits include 4 and 4, 5 and 3, 6 and 2, and 7 and 1. Spending 2 Karma raises this soft cap by 2, allowing the soft cap to be (Charisma × 2) + 2, or in this case 10. This does not buy any additional points; it just allows more points to be placed in a single contact. The hard cap for contacts at creation is 8, so this higher soft cap could not be used to make a 9 and 1 contact. 8 and 2 would be the maximum divide for the Loyalty and Connection ratings.

# Using Types

The type of a contact has a direct effect on what they can do for you—it impacts the information available during legwork and what gear the contact can acquire. Some services are only available from certain types—for example, Government types, typically police contacts, can be used to reduce the Heat on a team.

For legwork (a Connection + Connection test using the table on p. 50, *SR6*) count their Connection Rating as 1 higher than it actually is for

**CONTACT TYPES // (META)HUMAN RESOURCES**


---


acquiring gear when the contact’s type closely matches the information or gear sought. Other similar types of contacts use their actual Connection rating, and contacts of an opposing type use an effective Connection rating 1 lower than their normal rating. At the gamemaster’s discretion, directly opposed types may actually be –2 below the actual Connection rating, like asking a Street contact about Corporate info. Contacts may also have a specific affiliation that further increases their effective Connection rating. For example, a Seattle-based Lone Star Detective may have either Government or Corporate as a type, but legwork regarding their specific affiliation (Seattle area, law enforcement, or the OmniStar corporation) will add a further +1 to their Connection rating for those subsets of information. There is no specific penalty associated with not having a specific affiliation, but gamemasters may apply one if they feel it is appropriate. Some contacts may have a second type, like choosing the Lone Star Detective above to be both Government and Corporate, this gives access to a wider range of information and gear, but it removes the 1-point Connection rating increase that the single-type contacts have.

When using a contact to acquire gear (see p. 244, SR6), the Availability of the gear sought must be lower than this modified Connection rating, accounting for type and other factors.

Contacts gained in Character Creation allow the player to decide on the type, but contacts gained during gameplay have their type determined by the gamemaster. Contacts can have one or two types, but those with two types are less effective in a focused area than a contact with one type. As always, the gamemaster has the final say on what type matches the information or gear sought.

# CONNECTION RATING AND CONTACT ARCHETYPES

The connection rating is a measure of how much a contact knows as well as the limit for what gear the contact can acquire. So what’s the difference between a first-day-on-the-job beat cop and the chief of police? Mainly the Connection rating. Contacts are categorized in a way similar to player characters, where one archetype can represent a wide cross section of individuals. *Shadowrun, Sixth World* notes that the Mafia Consigliere archetype (see p. 213, *SR6*) could also apply to a Yakuza wakagashira or a Triad incense master. With a lower or higher Connection ratings, this one contact archetype also represents every organized crime figure from street-level thugs up to the Don or the Oyabun. For the most part, only the titles change, but the gamemaster may also adjust the sample profile to account for the different level of experience represented by the title. Add (or subtract) a number of points equal to two times the difference in the Connection rating to attributes. The gamemaster can also do the same for skills, as they may add or subtract whatever skills are appropriate.

> ### Increasing a Contacts Connection Rating
>
> A runner can invest their time, nuyen and karmic capital into helping their contacts increase their Connection Rating and reach new heights in their profession. This is a significant investment of the runner’s own time and energy. Increasing a contact’s Connection rating by 1 point requires some influence (1 Karma x new Connection Rating), time (1 week x new Connection Rating) and cash (new Connection rating 1–3 = 1,000 nuyen x new rating, 4–6 = 3,000 nuyen x new rating, 7–9 = 5,000 nuyen x new rating, 10–12 = 10,000 nuyen x new rating,). A contact also gains 1 point to their attribute profile and increases an active skill by one point when they increase their Connection rating by 1 point. Helping a contact increase their Connection rating also earns the runner (new Connection rating) in Favor Points with that contact (see p. 172 for more information on Favor Points.)

# CONTACTS: EXPANDED INFORMATION

The following explores what types are appropriate for the contacts presented in the *SR6* and gives them a typical Connection rating.

### Bartender
* Typical Connection Rating: 1  
* Type: Street (also Corporate, Matrix or Magical)  

The full range of restaurant, bar, and nightclub workers fall under this archetype, including cooks, DJs, waitstaff, bouncers, and strippers. The exact type is going to depend on what kind of establishment they work in. At a higher Connection rating, this archetype would be a manager or a club owner. Larger and more prestigious establishments will always create higher Connection ratings overall—anyone working at Dante’s Inferno will have a higher Connection rating than their peers at Joe’s Bar and Grill.

# BEAT COP
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Government (also any except Criminal)  

The Beat Cop also includes dispatchers and paralegal clerks, with a lower Connection rating it could be a snitch, rent-a-cop, or a security guard. With a higher Connection rating, the doors open to undercover cop, desk sergeant, detective, agent (as in FBI or CIA), commander or even as someone as high as the director of a national bureau. Specialists within a department may focus on a specific activity like magical investigations, Matrix crimes, or public relations, and could be any other type except maybe Criminal. They may specialize in a particular sphere of influence like a fence, infobroker or a loan shark. Fixers tend to keep the same title regardless of their actual Connection rating; they just widen their networks and become progressively better at what they do.

# FIXER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Street (also Criminal, Corporate, Government, Matrix or Magic)  

Fixers are the shadow contacts who always know who to call to get something done, and they sometimes fill the role of Mr. Johnson. They may be independent, work for one of the big 10, an organized crime syndicate, or even a dragon, and they may specialize in a particular sphere of influence like a fence, infobroker or a loan shark. Fixers tend to keep the same title regardless of their actual Connection rating; they just widen their networks and become progressively better at what they do.

# MAFIA CONSIGLIERE
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Criminal  

This archetype represents the spectrum of organized criminals. While the Consigliere represents the mid-level of organized crime, lower Connection ratings represent street-level enforcers such as Blue Lanterns, soldati, or kobun, and with a higher rating this contact may become the oyabun, don, or pakhan.

# MECHANIC
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Engineering (also Street or Corporate)  

Car or drone dealers, chop-shop mechanics, and transport service providers like taxi drivers or smugglers fall under this archetype. With a higher Connection rating, the contact might be a highly skilled independent operator, a corporate design engineer, or a company owner.

# MR. JOHNSON
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Street (also Criminal, Corporate, or Government)  

A Mr. Johnson may be a one-time independent operator, a fixer working as a front man for another Johnson, or they could directly represent the interests of the most powerful individuals, corporations, and governments in the Sixth World. If a contact is in the business of hiring runners, the name is Mr. Johnson, Tanaka-san, or Herr Brackhaus, regardless of the actual Connection rating.

# STREET DOC
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Medical (also Corporate, Criminal, Magical or Street)  

All sorts of biotechs fall under this archetype. Service providers for first aid and medical care like a street shaman, nursing assistant, or a paramedic will have a lower Connection rating, while a Tamanous organ harvester is even less connected. At the other end, corporate medical specialist mages and delta clinic cyber-surgeons have a substantially higher rating.

> ## OPTIONAL RULE FOR USING CONTACTS  
> Every contact is a person, and they have their own problems and obligations—they don’t just sit by the commlink waiting for the runner to call. If the GM wants to represent this, have the runner make a roll to see if a contact is available to do a favor or if they have time to discuss some topic. The higher the Connection rating of a given contact, the less likely it is that they will be available. Roll 2d6 and add the numbers together; if the total equals or exceeds the contact’s Connection rating, the runner is able to get in touch with the contact. Edge may not be used on this roll.  
> As another method, the gamemaster may elect to substitute the Loyalty rating of the contact for one of the dice, making the roll 1d6 + Loyalty. Regardless of modifiers, a roll of 1 always fails to connect and a 6 always succeeds. If a 2 through 5 is rolled, at the contact’s Loyalty to the toll. If the resulting number equals or exceeds the contact’s Connection rating, the call reaches the contact.  
> The method used should be applied consistently; don’t switch back and forth between the two methods.  
> Group contacts do not require a roll to reach them, since at least a few people within any group can be reached at any time regardless of the Connection rating of the group.

# TALISMONGER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Magic (also Corporate, Criminal, or Street)  

Alchemists, talismongers, talisleggers, enchanters as well as lore masters and arcanists are the source for spell formulas, foci, and reagents. The titles associated with this type have more to do with how they operate or the specialty they provide than with the Connection rating, which tends to be a measure of how effective a contact is within their specialty.

# NEW CONTACTS

## ARMORER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Criminal, Engineering, or Government)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Tailor, Quartermaster, Shopkeeper  

The Sixth World is a dangerous place, and ballistic cloth has become cheap, legal, and nearly ubiquitous. At one time an armorer provided both weapons and armor, but somewhere along the way the weapon sales aspect dropped out of use. Armorers now mainly provide body armor, armor modifications, and tailoring services for custom fittings. Basic off-the-rack versions of body armor can be bought from the local Kong-Wal Mart, if you don’t mind using your SIN, but the proprietor of an independent clothing shop will have the same items with less recordkeeping. Tailors at specialty shops offer the latest fashions and custom fitting. Police, corporate security and the military maintain their own supplies of body armor distributed through secure supply depots, where inventory-counting mistakes always seem to happen.

anything you need, from a hold-out pistol to an assault cannon, for the right price. In addition to firearms, this contact’s area of expertise includes regular and specialty ammo, a wide assortment of melee weapons, and gunsmithing work to incorporate those wiz custom mods. Some Arms Dealers are retailers operating a legitimate business like the Weapon World franchise at your local mall. They may be convinced to sell something off the books, but anything too illegal is out. Others work out of a military or corporate depot, where mistakes in inventory are difficult and expensive, but still happen. Then there are the weapons traffickers who are anything but legitimate, dealing in the most destructive and illegal items, selling to anyone with the nuyen and constantly on the move, attempting to stay one step ahead of the law.

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 5  
* **Type:** Magical (also Corporate, Criminal, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Enchanter, Qi Tattooist, Renkinjitsu-shi, Wise Woman  

The Artificer is a powerful Awakened contact who specializes in the creation of foci and other magical devices. This is a rare skill set, and it puts this contact in high demand within the magical community. In addition to being able to provide assorted types of foci, the Artificer is very knowledgeable about the lore of their tradition relating to physical artifacts. They also know most of the Awakened within a given area, either personally or by reputation. They can be a source of news or a way to obtain an introduction to other members of the magical community. Titles associated with this contact archetype have more to do with the tradition of the practitioner than any particular Connection rating.

## Bounty Hunter

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Criminal, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Bail Bondsman, Big Game Hunter, Parasecurity Expert, Park Ranger  

The Bounty Hunter is an expert at tracking down people who are not interested in being found. They tend to be equally proficient at social skills, combat, and technical skills. They also know plenty of experts that can provide back-up in any field where they may have a gap in their own skills. Not every bounty is for the two-legged variety though, some Bounty Hunters focus on hunting down paracritters and other animals. Bounties may be issued if a creature is causing damage to communities or maybe when someone just wants to collect a valuable specimen. Either way, this contact is an expert at tracking and survival in wilderness environments. Corporations also have a need for Parasecurity Experts to acquire and handle dangerous biological assets, and anyone in the market for a particular critter will need someone to track one down for capture. The Connection rating for this archetype is more a measure of success and personal skill, and the titles attached tend to be more related to the actual specialty of the Bounty Hunter.

## Chemist

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Engineering (also Criminal, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Corporate Scientist, Demolitions Expert, Pharmacist, Toxicologist  

Street drugs, toxins, explosives—they all have to come from somewhere. With the right equipment and raw materials, the Chemist can make them all, and more. Some work for one of the big criminal syndicates or the larger gangs, while other times the Chemist is a completely independent operator, providing compounds to anyone with enough nuyen. Either way they can be a valuable contact to have. In addition to the compounds they can provide, the Chemist is a good source of news, like who else is buying what, and what they plan to do with it. They can provide an introduction.

## CITY WORKER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 1  
* **Type:** Government (also Corporate, Engineering)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Dockworker, Firefighter, Garbage Collector, Janitor, Maintenance Worker  

Somebody has to keep the streetlights working, and the water running, and the sewers clear, plus all the other services that modern society counts on. It’s not automated, hundreds of metahumans, maybe thousands, quietly work these blue-collar jobs every day, in every metroplex and city. These underpaid, unappreciated, and normally unseen workers are good contacts for a runner to cultivate a relationship with. You never know when you will need the layout of the sewers under a target, or what transformer to blow to take down a particular building’s power. As the Connection rating goes up, these contacts become crew leaders, supervisors, and department managers.

You may be thinking of the crew that comes around weekly to tidy up your doss, but this contact has a more specific specialty: cleaning up crime scenes. They may be a freelancer using bleach and hard work—or perhaps magic—to scrub a room of all evidence, or a mob associate who can make a  

## COLLEGE PROFESSOR
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Academic (also Matrix, Magical, Media, Medical)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Analyst, Researcher, Scientist, Thaumaturgist, Theoretical Matrix Engineer  

The College Professor usually focuses on a single narrow branch of knowledge and how to explain it inside a classroom or its application in a laboratory. This contact is an expert on a single topic that could be anything from arcano-archaeology to zoology, and they will be more than happy to discuss any of the finer points of their research—at length. The Connection rating typically represents the level of expertise and the contact’s relative ranking among their peers. This type of contact is great for legwork about a topic, if it’s within their field, or maybe even a related branch of knowledge. Keep in mind that they tend to lack knowledge of the practical application of their field. Don’t expect a professor specializing in neuro-cybernetic interface devices to actually be able to install any cyberware.

(META)HUMAN RESOURCES // NEW CONTACTS


---


This contact archetype includes just about all of the non-security personnel that work for one of the Big Ten, their subsidiaries and the smaller independent corporations. You can also include the bureaucrats in most government offices—just drop the “corporate” from the tag. Wageslaves are the entry-level workers who keep the corporations running—job titles are just a matter of their exact job description, and how well connected they are. This contact can be a great source of information about the corporation they work for as well as rumors about the competition. Wageslaves with access to the company’s physical assets can also be a great source for off-the-books gear. As the Connection rating increases, the Wageslave moves up the corporate ladder, the title changes to Team Leader, Department Manager, Special Project Coordinator, and finally Executive.

## DECKMEISTER

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 5  
* **Type:** Matrix (also Corporate, Criminal, Government, Media)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Host Admin, IT worker, Matrix Gamer, Shadow BBS Sysop, Technician

The Deckmeister is the guy who has the gear, as long as the gear you’re looking for is a cyberdeck, deck module, or a program. This contact keeps tabs on all the new Matrix research coming out of Chiba and has the connections to get you the hottest tech. These same connections are also good for finding RCCs, cyberjacks and other high-tech gear, but the Deckmeister doesn’t have the same passion for non-Matrix tech. Trade-ins of older equipment are welcome, and the constant upgrades to the latest nova-hot gear creates a good stock of slightly below SOTA equipment that the Deckmeister needs to move. This contact also operates as a fence buying and selling all sorts of paydata. They stay on top of all the news and rumors about computer research, Matrix tech, local deckers, and Matrix gangs. At a lower Connection rating, this contact archetype becomes a Matrix Gamer, Technician, or an IT worker. A higher Connection rating could be an admin or even a sysop of a large host, maybe even from a famous shadowsite like the Nexus or Jackpoint.

## ENTERTAINER

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Media (also Corporate, Magical, Matrix, Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Artist, MeFeed/P2 Influencer, Pro Athlete, Rocker, Sim-Star, Trid Actor

Entertainers run the spectrum between old-school rockers on stage belting out “the truth” with a neo-metal anti-corp call to action, to the rookie combat biker trying to make his name on the circuit, or a nova-hot simstar sheltered in a corp enclave protected by the best security, just like the valuable asset she is. All Entertainers, regardless of the brand of entertainment, have one thing in common: everyone wants to be around them and be seen with them. Having a famous Entertainer as a contact will open doors for the runner that they would never be able to open on their own. Of course, that star power has its own risks—runners will have to be extra careful not to be seen in public with their contact or let their illegal actions trace back to the Entertainer. Nothing sets off the paparazzi like mysterious, possibly dangerous arm-candy seen out with a famous personality. Connection ratings are a measure of fame and success; titles are simply the variety of entertainment they provide. Media stars and their entourages are great sources for rumors about what’s happening behind the scenes in the entertainment industry. Entertainers also make great diversions; nothing takes attention off what the runners are up to like a famous trid actor showing up at a pub around the corner.

**NEW CONTACTS // (META)HUMAN RESOURCES**


---


Gang members fill the roles between independent criminal operators and members of the large syndicates—that is, unless the gang is big enough to be their own syndicate. Most make money by running protection rackets in their neighborhoods or dealing in street drugs or BTLs for the syndicates. Having a gang member who can vouch for you will give you a free pass in the gang’s territory, and if they are well placed in the gang, they may be able to swing other favors. They can also be a good source for whatever the gang is selling, as well other restricted or illegal material like cheap weapons and ammo. Gang members, especially the better-connected ones, can also provide introductions to the local Mafia made men, Yakuza kobun or Triad blue lanterns. A higher Connection rating means a higher standing in the gang, maybe lieutenant or leader of the local crew. Members of larger gangs, especially the national gangs, will have a higher Connection rating than members of smaller gangs.

## GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Government (also Corporate, Media, Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Activist, Demagogue, Lobbyist, Politician, Spokesperson, Tribal Chief, Voice  

The Government Official may hold a minor elected position such as local councilman or a Judge, alternatively they could also be a mid-level appointed official like a health inspector. Either way this contact is usually well placed enough to call in some favors and take the heat off of a friend. The Government Official can make introductions to other Government types, and they also tend to have a lot of other well placed Corporate, Media, and probably Criminal contacts. With a lower Connection rating, this contact archetype could be an activist, political intern, or a government employee such as a file clerk, while higher Connection ratings may represent the Voice of a great dragon or offices up to the highest positions in national governments.

## HITMAN
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Criminal, Government, Engineering)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Arsonist, Mugger, Mob Enforcer, Corporate Assassin  

The Hitman has a simple job: They kill people for money, either loudly or quietly, and they tend to be very good at it. They could be an independent contractor, work for one of the main crime syndicates, one of the megacorps, or even some black-ops department within a national government. Those with a lower Connection rating may be an arsonist for hire or a leg-breaker for the mob. Below that is the street thug at the bottom of the violent criminal food chain, mugging old ladies for pocket nuyen. Killers with higher Connection ratings become members of an elite fraternity, capable of taking out the most well-protected targets and charging the most astronomical fees. These contacts are a good source of information on current events inside the organizations they work with and always have superior contacts for providing arms, armor, tech gadgets and even magical goods like alchemical preparations or foci.

## ID MANUFACTURER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 5  
* **Type:** Street (also Criminal, Matrix)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Blackmailer, Data Broker, Forger  

Have you ever wanted—or needed—to be someone else? Then the ID Manufacturer is the contact you should talk to. Using a mix of forgery, data collection, and social engineering, with the subtle manipulation of government and corporate databases, new identities can be created out of whole cloth. The process is expensive, complicat-

ed, and time consuming—the best fake identities require years of preparation before they can be sold, but the resulting SINs are worth every nuyen spent. Less skilled individuals working in the “trade” may be data brokers collecting information for resale or forgers creating documents less involved than a SIN, like licenses and permits. ID Manufacturers with a higher Connection rating become true masters, capable of creating works of art tailored to their customers’ exact specifications and that are capable of withstanding the most intense scrutiny.

## LAWYER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Types:** Academic (also Criminal, Corporate, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Accountant, District Attorney, Negotiator, Public Defender, Shark, Shyster  

Sooner or later there comes a time in every professional criminal’s life when you will need the services of a Lawyer. It’s probably a good idea to already have a good relationship with one before that day comes. The Lawyer understands the legal procedures required to interact with both the corps or the government. Better than that, they also know all the dirty tricks and workarounds to get the results their clients expect. Of course, the corps and the government have their own Lawyers, and these can be great contacts, too. A call from the local DA can do wonders for taking the heat off, and they always have some off-the-books dirty work that needs to be done in return. This contact archetype with lower Connection ratings can be a clerk or a special investigator. Higher ratings represent successful criminal defense lawyers, high-stakes corporate negotiators, or attorneys working at high levels of national governments.

## LOREKEEPER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Magical (also Academic, Corporate, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Arcanist, Arcano-Archaeologist, Occultist, Sage, Spirit Guide, Witch Doctor  

The Lorekeeper is an Awakened contact who focuses on understanding the origins, nature, and practical application of magic—what it is and how metahumanity interacts with it, along with the nature of the astral plane and the numerous metaplanes. These are all topics this contact seeks to understand through the legends and lore that have been handed down through the millennia to various cultures. The greatest mysteries the Lorekeeper are fascinated by are the spells, traditions, and artifacts scattered around the world that predate the Awakening but still have power. This contact is a source for spell formulas, and they can provide assistance with initiating in the deeper mysteries of magic. Lower Connection rating contacts of this archetype may not be Awakened but operate with a theoretical understanding of magic. Those with the lowest rating are charlatans and fortune tellers out to fleece the gullible. Lorekeepers at a higher Connection rating are truly powerful and knowledgeable individuals capable of traveling the metaplanes, seeking answers, and perhaps even taking others with them.

## NEWS REPORTER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Media (also Corporate, Matrix, Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Editor, Journalist, Media Mogul, Paparazzi, Pirate Trid Broadcaster, Vlogger  

The News Reporter may be an independent investigator out to expose the corrupt and powerful, or they could work for a sleazy tabloid only interested in the most lurid gossip. Either way the News Reporter will always be interested in any secrets a runner may uncover, and they have plenty of their own secrets they might share with a friend. This contact is great for moving attention away from a runner with a well-crafted screamsheet story, and of course

they stay up to date on all the hottest rumors. News Reporters usually maintain their own contacts and can provide an introduction to a surprisingly wide assortment of people. As the Connection rating increases, this contact archetype represents more successful and well-known news professionals as well as media broadcasters ranging from the local trid pirate broadcasting “the truth” out of the back of a van to the most influential corporate media mogul.

## PICKPOCKET
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 1  
* **Types:** Street (also Criminal)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Bookie, Burglar, Conmen, Fence, Jewel Thief, Loan Shark, Street Dealer  

The typical Pickpocket is a petty criminal who makes a living with non-violent illegal activities. These people tend to keep their eyes open about what happens in their neighborhoods and are a good source for the local street-level rumors. They have access to underground networks moving low-value stolen merchandise and illegal items such as street drugs, BTLs, and cheap weapons and ammo. As the Connection rating increases, this contact archetype represents criminals who are more ambitious in their crimes and proficient in their chosen profession. As well as increasing their reputation among their peers some may even reach a point where their high-profile exploits make their way into the national screamsheets.

## POLICLUB MEMBER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 1  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Matrix, Magical)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Activist, Cult Member, Freedom Fighter, Terrorist  

The Sixth World can be a stressful place, as the social upheavals of the last seventy years have left their mark on the collective psyche on metahumanity. People of all varieties seek out like-minded individuals to work toward common goals in special interest groups. The largest and most successful are political organizations, or policlubs. Some can be relatively benign, with lofty goals like MOM (Mothers Of Metahumans), while others have a darker ethos, such as the Sons of Sauron or Humanis. Organizations can branch out in other directions—some become cults such as the Aleph Society or the Children of the Dragon, others fall into outright terrorism, like TerraFirst!. The Connection rating of a Policlub Member is a measure of the status within the organization. This contact is a good source for news about what’s happening within the group, as well as information on other members. They can also provide effective distractions, getting the members of the group to protect and picket a nearby location, moving the spotlight off whatever the runners are doing.

## SAFEHOUSE MASTER
* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Criminal, or Government)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Coffin Hotel Manager, Hotel Concierge, Realtor, Slum Lord  

Sooner or later every runner will need a place to lie low and keep out of sight. This is the specialty of the Safehouse Master. Accommodations range through the entire spectrum of possibilities. At the low end, a safehouse may just be a coffin in a little-used hotel where the owner has a stash of supplies, and most are little more than a hidden and shielded room over a kitchen or a factory floor. At the other end may be a luxury suite with anthrodrone servants that has been encased in a Faraday box and surrounded with powerful wards cutting it off from the world. The Connection rating of the Safehouse Master generally determines the quality of the safehouse, but many successful operators maintain numerous locations with varying costs, services, and levels of security.

## SENSEI

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 4  
* **Type:** Magical (also Corporate, Criminal, Government, or Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Dojo Master, Martial Arts Instructor, Spirit Warrior, Swordmaster  

An Awakened contact, the Sensei is a powerful adept and provides guidance to other adepts as they travel along the path to unlocking their inner power. This contact typically operates at a gym, dojo, temple or even a wilderness area where instruction can be provided to those who seek them out. The Sensei can provide training and assistance with initiations. Many follow a particular religion and are able to provide spiritual guidance in addition to their more practical duties. Sensei provide services to many types of students at their training halls and can be a great source of news about the magical community. They are also well connected, able to provide introductions to numerous people both in and out of their type. At lower Connection ratings, this archetype may not be Awakened but still operate a gym or dojo. Higher ratings represent a Sensei who is powerful personally and may be a mystic adept able to give instruction on other uses for magic. A few are even enchanters able to tattoo qi foci on those who are proven worthy to receive them.

## SMUGGLER

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 3  
* **Type:** Engineering (also Criminal, Government, Street)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Coyote, Fence, Importer, Logistics Coordinator, Nomad, VTOL Pilot  

Every nation state has borders, and borders are all about controlling what and who gets across them. The Smuggler is in the business of moving people and goods across those borders without drawing the attention of the officials and soldiers charged with protecting them. This contact has extensive knowledge of the terrain along the border they work across as well as an understanding of the technological and magical security in place. They also understand the routines of the border patrol agencies and probably have several good contacts among those same agencies to provide intel and maybe look the other way if that ends up being the only way across. Smugglers operate by a range of techniques; some rely on the speed and nape-of-the-earth flying of a Banshee, others rely on concealment, hiding their goods in secret compartments of vehicles, while a few even go with low-tech strategies such as trains of pack animals (or metahumans) moving through rugged terrain. Smugglers can be a good source of illegal or restricted gear, but their true value is in moving a team across national borders without having to answer pesky questions about the grenade launcher in your luggage.

## SOLDIER

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Government (also Corporate, Magic, Matrix)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Combat Decker, Combat Mage, Corpsec, Drone Rigger, Mercenary  

Soldiers could be corporate security, regular national military, or metroplex guardsman. What they have in common is protecting property and personnel from outside actors (like shadowrunners). Just like many other under-appreciated and underpaid workers, they can be convinced to pass along some sensitive information or look the other way if the price is right and the risk is low. The bulk of Soldiers are entry level and trained in ranged and melee combat. Elite forces and high-threat response (HTR) teams have higher Connection ratings along with higher skills and better stats. Specialists such as drone riggers, facility spiders, and security wage mages work apart from the rank and file, but they still report to the same boss. A Connection rating above 6 represents those in leadership roles who tend to be more like politicians or corporate executives than the rank-and-file they lead.

## Squatter

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 1  
* **Type:** Street  
* **Similar Contacts:** BTL Addict, Joygirl/Joyboy, Snitch, Street Vendor, Tamanous Member  

From the megacorp’s point of view, the SINless squatter is a non-person. Of course, the millions of squatters around the world who live in abandoned buildings, drainage tunnels, and back-alley shelters have a different point of view. Squatters live on the frayed edge of society, most do not have SINs and deal in barter, cash transactions, and certified credsticks. Squatters are survivors who get by with what they can scavenge or find on the street. The most industrious operate pushcarts, selling street food or sundries, while others survive by selling their bodies. Some even make a living selling other people’s bodies (to Tamanous or other organleggers—hopefully after they’re done using them). If you want to find out what’s happening on the street, find a local Squatter and ask. A few nuyen will get you the lowdown on the local gangs and criminals. If you’re lucky, you may even get some intel on that hidden corp blacksite located nearby.

## Store Owner

* **Typical Connection Rating:** 2  
* **Type:** Street (also Corporate, Criminal)  
* **Similar Contacts:** Antiquities and Oddities Dealer, Pawn Shop Owner, Restaurateur  

Store Owners are integral parts of the neighborhoods their shops are located in. They not only provide goods or a service, but they interact with the residents of the community on a regular basis, so they know all of the local news and can provide an introduction to any of the locals who a shadowrunner may want to talk to. This archetype includes the owners and operators of small shops providing legal goods like electronics or clothing, restaurants ranging from soykaf shops to sit-down fine dining, and the ubiquitous Stuffer Shacks. Of course, some stores are nothing more than fronts for illegal operations like gambling, drugs, or prostitution, and the Store Owner is a member of the organized crime syndicate that runs the show.

# Earning and Spending Favors

If there is one thing certain about working in the shadows, it’s that sooner or later you’ll need a favor from a friend. You may need help locating some new gear without the proper license, getting patched up after a firefight without anyone reporting it, finding a safehouse to lie low in, or simply gaining some key information about a target. In the Sixth World, the most common currency for this type of transaction between you and your contacts is favors.

Generally, favors come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. For the purpose of tracking favors, runners will be able to earn and spend Favor Points, where a small favor is worth 1 Favor Point and a large favor is worth 3 Favor Points. Sometimes other circumstances affect the actual total of the points accumulated. Favor Points can be used to get information, provide a no-questions-asked service, reduce the fees on acquiring gear, or gain additional Loyalty with the contact. While a runner may save up favors that a contact owes them, if a runner gets in a situation where they owe favors to a contact, that contact is likely to call it in relatively quickly.

Runners can earn Favors Points during a session several different ways, depending on the contact. This could be as simple as a favor from Mr. Johnson for finishing a job without causing them any extra headaches. While it may seem counterintuitive that the runners get paid to do a job and come out of it still gaining some Favor Points, Mr. Johnson knows that the runner could say no, cause them extra problems, or even betray them on a run. When a runner uses a contact to get info, gear, or other service, they can gain Favor Points if they

# RUNNERS GAINING FAVOR POINTS

## 1 FAVOR POINT
* Completing a paid job with no complications at a negotiated price  
* Giving a contact first shot at buying relevant paydata  
* Preventing a third party from causing an inconvenience to the contact  
* Making a (1,000¥ x connection rating) purchase at full price  
* Sending a paying customer (purchase 500¥ x connection rating) to the contact  
* Paying for information (50¥ x connection rating)  
* Using 1 point of Karma to buy a favor (only 1 favor per week can be bought)  
* Spending (1,000¥ x connection rating) to buy a favor (same as buying with Karma)  

## 2 FAVOR POINTS
* Completing a job that’s personally important to the contact at the negotiated price  
* Giving a contact relevant paydata for free  
* Prevented a third party from causing a negative circumstance for the contact  
* Making a (10,000¥ x connection rating) large purchase at full price  

## 3 FAVOR POINTS
* Completing a job that’s extremely important to the contact at the negotiated price  
* Saving the life of the contact or someone in their immediate family  

## SPECIAL
* Helping a contact increase their Connection Rating with time, nuyen, and Karma, earns a number of Favor Points equal to the contact’s new Connection rating.  

## +1 FAVOR POINT
* Accepting a job at a discount (lower than initial offer by Connection x 500¥)  
* Tipping well for information or a service (+5% or +50¥ x connection rating)  

## -1 FAVOR POINT
* Negotiating a substantial increase in payment (over initial offer by Connection x 1,000 nuyen; the face may run the negotiations, but the entire team gets the benefits and the consequences)  
* Causing an inconvenience to the contact as a result of the runners’ actions  
* Selling paydata relevant to a contact to the contacts competitor  
* Asking for a discount on products or services (-1 point for each five percent discounted)  

## -2 FAVOR POINTS
* Causing (physical or financial) harm to the contact as a result of the runners’ actions  

----

Pay well and treat the contact fairly. During a run the characters may happen on some paydata that will have significance to one of their contacts. The resulting Favor Points earned will be based on how much the contact pays for the paydata. Outside of a session or run, runners can also spend downtime to earn favors with contacts. Hunting for favors is always less effective than those that come naturally and may involve energy spent doing some type of free task for the contact or spending time and nuyen socializing with the contact.

The Favors Points are reduced where the runners make things inconvenient or unpleasant for the contact. It could be asking for a discounted price on services or gear that cuts into the contact’s profit, causing problems for the contact, or even causing actual harm as a result of the runner’s actions. Selling information to a competitor or simply driving a hard enough bargain on the payment for a job that the contact feels like the runners have raked them over the coals.

Like any relationship, favors can flow both ways. Runners can ask a contact for a favor, spending saved Favor Points or placing them in the contact’s debt—but only a number of Favor Points up to the contact’s Loyalty. The size of the favor a contact is willing to do is going to be based on Loyalty and how much that they feel they owe. Maybe it’s a one-night bolt hole in the middle of a run and a local gang boss can supply something off the grid, or maybe it’s asking a smuggler to cut down the price of some gear. There are endless ways to use favors, but the key is that the type of favor needs to match the type of the contact you are calling it in from. Regardless of the situation, a contact may start to feel abused if a runner asks for too many favors too often. If the runner asks for a number of Favor Points that exceeds the contact’s Loyalty

# Increasing a Contact’s Loyalty Rating

A runner can spend accumulated favors to permanently increase the contact’s Loyalty rating. Increasing a contact’s Loyalty rating by 1 point requires the expenditure of a number of Favor Points equal to new Loyalty rating.

> In a single month, the runner will need to immediately do a small favor for the contact in return or lose a point of the contact’s Loyalty. If the runner’s extreme situation is more than the contact is willing to help with, they may ask favors in return, but this can only be done a number of times equal to their Loyalty. When a runner owes a contact more Favor Points than their Loyalty, the contact will go along with it—up to twice their Loyalty in additional favors—but the contact’s Loyalty will be reduced by 1 point afterward.

# GROUP CONNECTION RATINGS

A group’s Connection rating is built up from the following five areas:

**Membership** is the number of people active at or below the level where the runner is active.  
**Scope** is the area where the group operates, again at or below the level where the runner is active.  
**Finances** is a measure of the nuyen available to be used pursuing the group’s goals.  
**Magic** represents the number and power of the group’s awakened members.  
**Matrix** is the presence, reputation and resources available for actions in the matrix.

</table>

A runner can improve a contact’s Loyalty by telling the contact they are even on some favors and removing Favor Points equal to the next level of Loyalty. Obviously, this does not count toward the monthly limit for favors cashed in.

## GROUP CONTACTS

Group contacts are similar to individual contacts, but they consist of multiple individuals, sometimes hundreds, with a common interest that the runner shares. Groups have types and follow those rules. They are similar to individual contacts in other ways, but there are two key differences. First is that the Connection rating of a group is set by specific factors determined by how large the group is, its area of influence, and what its resources are. Second is that Loyalty is based on how much time and effort a runner puts into a group—you only get out what you are willing to put in.

A particular group’s Connection and Loyalty ratings only apply to the portion of the group that the runner directly interacts with. You may be a dues-paying member in good standing with the local branch of the DIMR, but you won’t be having tea with Nadja Daviar anytime soon.

To get the group’s Connection rating, add together the values of the five components. Note that it would be possible to create groups with Connection rating above 12, but organizations this powerful are outside the scope of what’s available to players, so the maximum rating is still capped at 12.

Group contacts can be bought during character creation the same as a normal contact but are not limited by the runner’s Charisma, groups may be joined by any runner regardless of their social skills. Remember that the five defining characteristics that determine the group’s Connection rating must be equal to the Connection rating purchased with the (Charisma x 6) points used at character creation.

## GROUP LOYALTY

Group contact Loyalty is a measure of the time and money invested in the organization by the PC. Maintaining Loyalty at a certain rank assumes that all the requirements from the lower Loyalty ranks are also observed. If the runner’s obligations from the current Loyalty level are not met over the course of a month, the group’s Loyalty moves down 1 point. The maximum Loyalty that a runner can have with a group is 8. Loyalty may only move up by 1 point per month, regardless of any actions PCs take, but multiple factors may drop the rating by up to one-half the current Loyalty rating over a single month.

Group Loyalty bought at character creation may not be higher than the Charisma of the runner, and this cap may not be altered. One exception is magical group contacts with a Karma cost to join, where Karma spent translates to +3 free Loyalty that is not limited by Charisma. If the time and

# EARNING AND SPENDING GROUP FAVORS

> Favor Points are not earned from groups in the way they are gained from individual contacts. Favor points are the result of the runners standing within the group as represented by Loyalty.  
> Spending Favors is the process of a runner using the group’s resources or calling on the members of the group and are exactly the same as Favor Points used on individual contacts. A runner may use the group’s resources at a rate of Favor Points = Loyalty over the course of a single month. If a runner is in a desperate situation, they may use more group resources than normally allowed, up to Loyalty in excess Favor Points. The group contact’s Loyalty will be reduced by 1 point until the end of the next month as if the runner had failed to meet their obligations for the month.  
> If the runner goes against the goals of the group, or if the strictures of a magical group are violated, this will result in a loss of Loyalty to the group. The exact number of Loyalty ranks lost depends on the nature of the transgression as decided by the gamemaster, but it will never drop by more than half the current Loyalty (rounded down).  
> If the Loyalty ever drops to zero, either through action against the group’s interests, abusing the group’s resources, or from simple non-participation, the runner is no longer a member of the group and may not draw on group resources. Re-joining a group may be as simple or as complex as the gamemaster decides to make it. It may be as simple as catching up on dues or it could require some elaborate penance or atonement.

# WHAT YOU GET

## THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE(STYLE)

First, you get a life, and it’s a lifetime sentence. This typically slots everyone off something fierce, which possibly is why the Sixth World is full of assholes. Then you have to live that life in some manner, which includes finding a place to sleep and put all your stuff, whether that be a blanket stuffed in a shopping cart or enough clothing and furniture to meet the needs of a small village.

This chapter provides the rules to let players customize their place of residence, going beyond the basic Lifestyle rules (p. 56, *SR6*). To start, there are six categories: Neighborhood, Necessities, Comforts, Security, Entertainment, and Space. Players should pick a level from each of those categories. These levels will add a designated number of Lifestyle Points (LPs) to the total for the place. After that, positive and negative qualities can be applied; they add and subtract LPs, respectively. Once the place is fully designed, the player has an LP total. Consulting the chart on p. 189 tells them what the monthly cost of the Lifestyle using that place will be, as well as what general Lifestyle category it fits into. Remember to pay the rent at the first of the month, because landlords want their money, and sometimes the superintendent of the building isn’t just there to fix things …

### Neighborhood

This is the area that your neighbors and you live in, and the type of place that attracts certain types of people. It is also an indication of police contractor presence, along with response requirements, time to respond, or even if they respond in the first place. Also, for most places, “Neighborhood Watch” means folks are using sensors on the outside of their buildings to keep track of the firefight going on in the street while they lie flat on the floor and try not to catch a stray bullet. Security Ratings are detailed on p. 239, *SR6*.

# ZONE DESIGNATIONS

Lone Star developed their Lettered Zone Designations to charge cities different rates while they delivered different types of service to different types of areas. This also helps cities “customize” their Peace Officer Service Packages during contract negotiations. The rating system exploded from there, becoming the standardized way to describe the lawfulness of an area even in public parlance. Other companies use the same system, paying Lone Star a small fee for doing so, as they often have public officials who refuse to deal with any other system. On top of that, being in charge of a higher-rated zone is often a bragging point to those officials as well as the SINners living there. For most shadowrunners, it is all too often used as a timer to help them track how long they have until an alarm goes off and they have to buzz turbo.

While not an official designation, Z-Zones have a special place with the security companies that take police contracts. They aren’t taken into consideration, officially, in negotiations, but the companies make sure they exist, even forcing them to, in order to point out what happens when your neighborhood gets too lawless and dangerous. The message is, “Be scared, SINners, and make sure you pay for better service packages, because the barbarians aren’t at the gates. They’re inside the city, just waiting to break into the nicer parts of town if not for the blue crews that keep them penned in.”

Lone Star has started a new experimental system using a White through Platinum zone designation system in newly independent Seattle, leaving the old Z-Zones as merely “Unlisted.” Time will tell if this catches on or not. So far, people still use the old system for the most part.

* **Z-Zone** (–1 LP)  
* **E-Zone** (Street Level, 0 LP)  
* **D-Zone** (Squatter, 1 LP)  
* **C-Zone** (Low, 2 LP)  
* **B-Zone** (Middle, 3 LP)  
* **A-Zone** (High, 4 LP)  
* **AA-Zone** (Luxury, 6 LP)  
* **AAA-Zone** (Luxury+, 7 LP)  

## NECESSITIES

The things that you need to survive. Water, food, basic clothing, bed, cleanliness, and for a lot of shadowrunners, synthalhol. These supplies can affect Natural Healing tests made while living where you are, some Social tests based on how you look and smell, and even determine first impressions. That fancy-hooped restaurant isn’t about to let you in looking and smelling like a street bum, no matter how big your credstick is.

## STREET (0 LP)

As low as you can go. You sleep in your clothes, use your shoes for a pillow (otherwise they’d be stolen from your feet). Your most valuable possession is the weapon you clutch against your body, hiding it to keep anyone from seeing it and deciding to take it from you. Your food comes from the dumpsters behind restaurants, and a mass brawl is often had for access to the containers at the better establishments. Water comes from the sky, puddles, or public bathrooms when you can beg your way into one—assuming that bathroom hasn’t used up its daily water ration. Cleanliness is only a chicken or BBQ joint’s wet napkin away. Malnutrition, dehydration, and exposure are constant companions. Hope you put some skill points into Outdoors: Urban! Maybe, if you’re very lucky, you can find a refrigerator box for shelter.

## SQUATTER (1 LP)

Well, you got a roof of sorts over your head—maybe a shanty of some sort, or a half-size shipping container that isn’t completely rusted out yet, or maybe even a monthly discount at the “Transients Welcome” coffin motel. Or perhaps you have a car or van you parked down by the river. Alternatively, a shelter took you in and now you have to hear their blathering at every mealtime they provide. Either way, you’re off the streets! Food varies from the cheapest options from vending machines to thin soup and a thinner sandwich from a soup kitchen. For the paranoid, there is out-of-country generic NutriSoy from a “reputable” fence who swears they got them before the drugs were added. Water comes from desalinization plants or public waterworks for a fee, black market water cooler bottles from truck heists gone wrong, or a camping water purifier that you run rainwater and your own pee through. It isn’t glorious, but you’re free from the Corps. And if you say that often enough, you can almost believe it.

## LOW (2 LP)

A drekhole apartment in a drekhole building in a drekhole world. But you have a bed or a reasonably comfortable couch to sleep on, some old but somehow functional kitchen appliances, and actual groceries of pre-pack meals with Bachelor Chow food replacement making up most meals. You have a bathroom with a shower stall that spits out lukewarm water (at best) during rationing hours. And after having the dreks for a week after you moved in, your body can handle the bacteria-infested public utility water that comes out of the taps. If only your neighbors would choose a time other than when you’re trying to sleep to have their daily, wall-ratting argument/make-up sex sessions. The only drugs you can afford is the cheapest of synthbeer that almost tastes like horse piss, only worse.

# Middle (3 LP)

While the middle class of old is slowly dying, the Lifestyle persists as a carrot to dangle in front of wageslaves, especially for the essentials it offers. The apartment or (emote:gasp) small house is fairly sound—and fairly sound-proof, too! You have some proper furniture, even if you had to assemble it yourself when you moved in or buy it from a used furniture store. Your auto-kitchen handles a lot of the work of feeding and watering you, including ordering groceries, and it makes sure to include the rare bit of real fruit (combined with vitamin and mineral supplements) to stave off sickness. The water is actually potable, unless there is an issue somewhere in the lines, which happens at least a few times a month. But the auto-kitchen boils it for you, and you actually get enough hot water to have a shower or even a bath once a day. You even have a small stock of drugs of your choice, typically decent synthahol. Sleep well, little wageslave, your 0800 – 2200 shift starts all too soon.

# High (4 LP)

Now we’re talking! Matching furniture from a reputable source, and not made from synthetic pressboard! A kitchen unit that makes synth-meals almost as if they were real food, and enough real food meals in the month to know the difference. No water rationing, consistent quality of water, and all the hot water you want. A fully stocked liquor cabinet, with a few tiny bottles of real liquor, along with a hidden stash of whatever other drugs you’re into. Thing is, if you sold your soul for middle class, what did this level cost you?

# Luxury (6 LP)

Custom-made furniture, real food every day, a waterfall in your bathroom to help you relax while you use the drekker, real logs in your real fireplace, all the drugs you can drink, snort, inject, smoke, or chip! What did it cost you? Everything? But totally worth it—right?

# Comforts

This is what can turn a squat into a home, and can make it harder to burn when the badges are coming up the stairs. It works with and enhances Necessities, as it includes better food, water quality and rationing, furniture, Matrix connection reliability, a ’kaf machine, and the materials to use in it, and materials and equipment needed for hobbies.

# Street (0 LP)

You must really go in for that whole spartan lifestyle, or you don’t have a choice. There is nothing in your squat other than the essentials, if that. If you even have a place to live.

# Squatter (1 LP)

If you have a place of your own, you actually have some scavenged (if damaged) furniture, maybe a deck of cards for the rare times you have company. If living in shared housing, like a coffin hotel, you have a few shared pieces of entertainment available, like the caged trid that is set to whatever channel the manager wants, along with some board games you can play with other occupants (the car piece, of course, is missing.)

# Low (2 LP)

You have your own trid, but only with basic service, a sound system dating back to the ’40s that somehow hasn’t blown its speakers yet, and a simsense unit that is, barely, better than running the simflicks on your commlink. You also have more furniture than the bare essentials, at least one of which can hold a troll’s bulk. Your food-prep station is ancient, but it can print out protein in beef, chicken, pork, and vegetarian flavors, but the texture stays the same (wet cardboard). There are still enough of the units on the market that getting the food packs are easy enough, for now. This also includes a small budget for an individual hobby—not many funds, but enough for the frugal hobbyist to do some things here and there.

# Middle (3 LP)

Bread and circuses, chummer! This is where the corps try to keep their important wageslaves at in order to keep them comfortable and loyal, but this level is often out of reach for others. Your kitchen is upgraded to include different types of flavor and textures for your food, with additional supplements built right into the printed meal so you don’t have to take them as pills. A decent high-definition trid unit with some service packages related to your hobbies (typically sports), a modern (if lackluster) simsense unit far superior to running the chips through your commlink, a beefy sound system that can go to a volume above a runner’s typical tinnitus, comfortable furniture of all types including a couch a chummer would be happy to surf on, and every legal app your commlink can run! As for hobbies, you have to save up, but you can afford pretty much any part of your hobby you want, eventually.

# High (4 LP)

This is the life. All the trid channels and some pay-per-view options, a classic sound system like they don’t make any longer, gaudy art on the walls.

---


(or tasteful art if you have the right Knowledge skills), and simsense-on-demand with a bleeding edge system! All the materials you’d ever want for your hobbies, space allowing. Finally, you have an awesome ’kaf maker that can actually handle real coffee without getting clogged or making the water too hot for the grounds.

## Luxury (6 LP)  
If you want it, you got it. Art on the walls (reproductions—the originals are in a safe somewhere, out of prying hands of thieves or the risk of fires), trid service that fits your personal tastes no matter what they are, a beyond-belief sound system (or maybe an actual live musician playing just for you for a few hours every day), gene-engineered tigers roaming the grounds, anything! Also, you get the haunting feeling that someone is coming after you, and even with all you have, you don’t have enough!

## Security  
Maybe you rely only on yourself, your gun, and your reputation, or maybe you use a street gang you’ve paid off or have a Connection with. You could opt for a security company that has the contract for your building/area and offers some elective services. Those are some of the options to help protect you from the other miserable slitches of the Sixth World. Security can also include defenses you’ve incorporated into your Lifestyle yourself, with or without the landlord’s permission or knowledge. Shadowrunners are masters of getting past security, so they know the point isn’t to make something invincible, but to make it difficult enough so that people do not want to bother.

## Street (0 LP)  
All you have is your rep, your weapons, and raw intimidation for security. Those weapons could be pawned for a good price if someone was looking for drugs or food. Or maybe they’d steal them and keep them to give them some security of their own.

## Squatter (1 LP)  
You have some kind of lockable container available, like a bus locker at a coffin hotel or a portable firesafe, and you pay the local gang protection money (and you hope they’ll protect you from someone besides themselves). When it comes down to it, though, the best protection you have is to look like you have nothing worth stealing. Of course, your organs can still be valuable to the right person, meaning you’ll carry market value with you right until you die—and maybe for a few hours afterward.

THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE(STYLE) // WHAT YOU GET


---


# Low (2 LP)

Decent locks, a door an ork might have to kick twice before it breaks, actual protection from a street gang or on-site rent-a-cop, and room in your budget for “home defense” ammunition allotment for your typical everyday carry. You may have also concealed some cheap weapons all around the place, such as Streetline Specials or simple knives—maybe even a grenade, just in case, even though it’s hard on local property values.

# Middle (3 LP)

A hacked version of the PanicButton! commlink app can get emergency services to your place eventually, although you’re more likely to call your beefier contacts or fellow runners for help. Good locks (plural), anti-kick bar on the door, cams in the area outside your hovel, and a beefy bribe to the local gang that you’ve explained the perks of long-term repayments over short-term gains, even if you had to use crayons. Alternatively, you’ve checkboxed the extended service payments to the rent-a-cops in your area and they actually give a frag about you. You have a dedicated door gun (shotguns are popular choices) and might have hidden some light pistols and a few grenades around the place if you’re overly paranoid.

# High (4 LP)

The rent-a-cops who have the contract for your area are skilled and willing to put in some effort, and the blue crews are only a few minutes away. For home defense, you probably have firearms above every doorway with additional ammo beside them, a waterproof “shower gun” that you’re just itching to try someday, and some scary knives to help you ask pointed questions of home intruders. For those times you’re away from home, a ceiling-mounted smart firing platform (weapon not included) keeps your home safe in the most aggressive way possible.

# Luxury (6 LP)

Personal security is for the poors. On-site security guards with military combat experience patrol the grounds, with drone support, and they’ve used silencers on their weapons ever since that day when they woke you in the middle of the day when some paparazzi jumped the wrong hedge wall. That doesn’t mean you’re unarmed—it is the Sixth World, after all—just that if you end up needing to use them, then someone in security is going to be fired!

# Entertainment

Beyond personal hobbies, this is how much extra there is in your Lifestyle budget to do things outside of the doss. At home, it is how wiz your sound system/trid/simsense unit is. Outside the home, it is clubbing, shopping, hanging with significant others or joytoys, and sport/concert/special event tickets.

# Street (0 LP)

If it’s free, you try it. Pity the suits let so few things be free. If you have a commlink, you go to various Matrix sites and look at things you can’t afford. You miss the days when libraries lent out free books.

# Squatter (1 LP)

Well, you’ve got some cards, dice, and some old and moldy RPG books, and not much else. Hope you have some people to play them with. For “social” drinking, you can afford the rare bottle of only the finest in flavored and fortified “bum wine” like Overnight Train, or troll-strength Krime Wine.

# Low (2 LP)

If you have a trid, you probably have an extra service package or two, or order a few pay-per-view events. You can afford a few synthbrews with the other regulars at the dive bar just down the street, and possibly invite your contacts there as well to talk to them about something other than biz. On the rare occasion, you can afford an arena ticket for sports or a favorite band.

# Middle (3 LP)

This is the mega’s “circuses” to go along with their “bread.” You have some disposable income, corp scrip for the wageslaves, credsticks for the runners. You can go on the occasional shopping spree, eat out every now and then at affordable restaurants, see a tridflick at the theater (or a classic flatflick for the highbrow crowds.) And when the day winds down, you can have a few good synthbooze drinks at a decent bar, or a weekly drinking contest with the rest of the wageslaves you work with and can’t remember the names of. Some get season tickets if they really like their sports, but others just get better seats at sports and concerts either for themselves or to use as currency when dealing with contacts.

# High (4 LP)

You have a usual table at a nice, classy bar where there is at least one draft that is real beer, and the occasional night of clubbing to dance with the pretty people. You can get season sports tickets and access to whatever concerts you or your contacts want to go to. And after paying someone to wax your car up, you can show it off on Cruise Night!

----

**WHAT YOU GET // THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE(STYLE)**


---


# Luxury (6 LP)

If you can conceive it, you’re pretty sure you can have it. VIP treatment at clubs where the owners know you on sight. Box seats for sports, theater, and operas. And your cars are the reason there are Cruise Nights in the first place.

## Space

Sometimes you need space for you, but other times you need it for your stuff, like all those rounds of ammo for that Krime Cannon you stash in a reeking old hockey bag. This quality covers how many rooms, parking for vehicles, and place for furniture and collectibles there are in your place. Filling all of those empty voids is up to you. Just remember: a bathroom is essential!

## Street (0 LP)

Ironically, the least amount of space is the most, as you have the whole world open to you! Of course, that makes it hard to keep your stuff that doesn’t fit into a shopping cart. Keep this in mind when choosing other parts of your Lifestyle.

## Squatter (1 LP)

Ranging from a coffin hotel to a makeshift shanty or camping tent, this gives you a place to call your own, sort of. Living out of a car or van also counts here.

## Low (2 LP)

An RV, trailer home, studio, or single-bedroom apartment are all options here. The spot has a tight but homey feel to it—unless you’re a troll, in which case it’s tight. You have a parking space outside the building or on the RV/trailer lot, but you’d better hope your vehicle has a good anti-theft system. Also, hope your hobby of choice has a small footprint. If you decide to use the couch as a bed, the bedroom can be used as a magic lodge, contain a shop’s worth of tools, or some other use.

## Middle (3 LP)

A two- or three-bedroom apartment or a small house awaits you and your hobbies. You could squeeze in a full magic lodge or a shop’s worth of tools and workbenches. You have an underground parking slot near the building, a monthly permit with a parking garage from an extraterritorial corporation that slows down any attempts at executing a warrant, or an actual garage for your house at the end of the driveway. Just be careful how deep you dig in the basement, unless you’re the one filling in those “surprises” down there.

# High (4 LP)

A proper home with a door and a (small) garden and a fence! Or a roomy apartment that takes up a quarter of the floor in your apartment building. You also have a garage, yes, even if you have an apartment, with room for your vehicle and a shop’s worth of tools and workbenches. Back at the apartment/home, you have all the space you want for your hobbies, unless you do something like collect classic cars or some other insane drek.

# Luxury (6 LP)

“You want to know the truth, I don’t think I’ve even been in this room before.” Your wine cellar is bigger than a Low lifestyle’s amount of space—that’s how big your place is. You have a multi-car garage with its own personal security drones. Dream it, Chummer, in a Sprawl, this amount of space is unbelievable!

## Optional Houserules

> What is the right way to play *Shadowrun*? The way your group has the most fun, of course! As complex or simple as they want it.  
>  
> There are many options for what these Lifestyle Attributes mean for gameplay. Neighborhoods can come into play when you’re trying to bring contacts or members of the shadowrunner team into different areas in the sprawl. A neighborhood where the neon-colored mohawked neo-anarchist with “Bite My Snake” tattooed on his forehead will blend in, sorta, will be different than one where an ultra-loyal corporate in his overpriced synthsilk suit will feel comfortable. Necessities can affect Natural Recovery (p. 120, *SR6*), as living in a gutter without replacement bandages invites infection, while living with a high-end apartment with a wonderfully stocked, high-end medkit and replacement sheets and blankets for days makes for an easier time of recovery. Comfort could assist with the stress of being a shadowrunner, because even if the run goes right, there’s still the risk of catching a secgoon’s stray bullet or getting tasered into prison. Security can impact a party searching for a way to get at a PC in their home, making it easier or harder to find out where they sleep. Entertainment can help or hinder keeping a contact’s Loyalty high, because let’s face it, no one likes being called all the time only to be asked for favors and the like (except fixers, as that’s their job).

THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE(STYLE) // WHAT YOU GET

# LIFESTYLE QUALITIES

There’s more to a squat than just the base portions of the place. There are also all the added little extras that one has in the home, has to live with or otherwise experiences that makes it part of a neighborhood or a community. These qualities can add to or subtract from the location’s Lifestyle Points.

## POSITIVE QUALITIES

### ARMORY

Hope you don’t have kids visit your place, because you’ve secretly concealed weapons all over the place. Ranging from a pistol in your favorite chair to SMGs and assault rifles over every doorway, you’re ready for a raging gunfight before you have to buzz turbo out of your place, likely burning it and the SIN connected to it as you leave. This quality purchases the weapons, ammunition, and the maintenance needed to keep them in efficient working order. It also covers the costs to conceal them, including bribes paid to landlords and property owners to keep them from flipping out if they see the array of weaponry.  
**Cost:** 2 LP/Level

#### GAME EFFECT

- **Level 1a:** You have a Light Pistol next to the place you spend most of your time in at your home, probably the chair in front of the trid, and knives, extendable batons, or brass knucks all around the place.  
- **Level 1b:** If you have a spare room, you have turned it into an armory, with a shop’s worth of weaponsmithing tools. Modify those firearms, sharpen those knives, add lead to the hitting end of clubs, put spikes on those brass knuckles, and keep your damned hands off that monofilament whip!  
- **Level 2:** You have a Heavy Pistol in your Horizon Lazyboi as well as in a bed holster and a waterproofed container in the shower. The pistols have speed loaders or clips handy there as well, and you have a spare fragmentation grenade hidden in the margarine keeper in the fridge.  
- **Level 3:** This is the bomb, literally. A fragging shotgun or assault rifle is hidden behind your chair, your couch is a gun locker, there are SMGs above every doorway, a waterproofed FN HAR Assault Rifle in the shower, and to top it all off, a self-destruct system is wired into your hovel for when you need to take off and leave no trace you ever existed.

### BAT CAVE

This is a dedicated room the resident uses to organize all the legwork the team does. Very popular in a bolthole for pre-mission planning.  
**Cost:** 1 LP/Level

#### GAME EFFECT

- **Level 1:** Cork boards, whiteboards, thumbtacks, and lots of different-colored thread to visually connect pieces of data. There’s also a kaf machine—wiz! When in a home with this quality, PCs can act as if they have a Knowledge skill relevant to the legwork they are performing that they do not otherwise have.  
- **Level 2:** Features an air-gapped computer system with a variety of AR displays that can be shifted to look like you’re playing an MMO—useful if you have this system in an apartment rather than a bolthole. The kaf machine is a commercial model that holds fifty cups of kaf. Twenty if you’re a troll. When in a home with this quality, PCs can act as if they have two Knowledge skills relevant to the legwork they are performing that they do not otherwise have.  
- **Level 3:** This command center features a decker/techomancer’s hacking chair, high definition holo-display in the center of the room so you can plan the insertion via the thermal exhaust port, AR displays everywhere, and the finest kaf machine you can find to keep everyone going when the long haul starts to wear off. When operating out of a home with this quality, PCs can act as if they have an extra point of Edge.

### BOLTHOLE/SAFEHOUSE

A bolthole is a place on the downlow that isn’t connected to any of your public SINs, especially if you have a real one. You pay for it in cash or certified credstick that you courier to the skeevy landlord who is willing to rent out space of that nature with no questions asked. Set it up, and only use it when the Heat is on. Or, with a larger site, use it only as a planning site before big jobs with the team so you don’t burn someone’s primary residence because you all got together in their living room trying to pass yourselves off as just a gaming group and failing miserably.

Safehouses, on the other hand, are also places to lie low when the Heat is on, but they are run by specialist fixers called “masters of the house,” who will charge you one hell of a lot, but also use their connections to lower the Heat on your group even faster by misdirection, evidence tampering, Matrix manipulations, and other ways they keep secret.  
**Cost:** 1 LP (Bolthole) / 2 LP (Safehouse)

#### GAME EFFECT

- **Bolthole:** Doubles the difficulty in discovering the location of a PC living in this location. Heat goes down as explained on p. 237, SR6.  
- **Safehouse:** The gamemaster creates the Lifestyle that the runner group will have to live with, and pay for, while the master/mistress does their thing.

**WHAT YOU GET // LIFESTYLE QUALITIES**


---


## Bribed Security
Be it slipping a few extra nuyen to the local gangers, or checkboxing elective priority service from the security contractor that protects your building/neighborhood, you get a response to situations that require security’s help much quicker. They’ll also tell you if suspicious people (other than your crew, they’re used to their ugly mugs) have been lurking around and taking an interest in you. Unless those people can pay more, of course. It’s nothing personal, just biz.  
**Cost:** 2 LP  

**Game Effect**  
Response time for situations involving this location are halved.

## Change of Jurisdiction
Someone is after you, but this pad isn’t located in a place where they have any authority. Most of the time, this means the property is part of a megacorp’s extraterritorial holdings. Local cops may not have permission to follow you, or try extradition through the international-intercorporate courts, but that often takes up far too much time. Note that if you slot off the corp whose property you live on, all bets are off, and this quality is eliminated.  
**Cost:** 3 LP  

**Game Effect**  
As long as you make it home, the cops chasing you likely can’t come after you without some really big legal muscle.

## Cleaning Service
Do you know how hard it is to get blood out of synthsilk? Well, yeah, most runners probably do. Two-parts vinegar, three-parts cold water, scrub hard, hang dry, just in case you didn’t know. A Cleaning Service, which includes a maid service that shows up twice a month to clean the apartment/house, also collects your clothing and body armor to clean and patch them, including anything out of them without any questions asked.  
**Cost:** 1 LP  

**Game Effect**  
Cleans your squat and patches clothing and armor of any damage, while also getting any nasty stains out of them.

## Defensive Setup
Either by luck or design, your home is set up to give protection even during a sneak attack. This only affects people who are regular visitors to your dump, as they know where all the good spots are to take cover.  
**Cost:** 1 LP  

**Game Effect**  
The defensive cover provides a Cover I status (p. 52, SR6) even if ambushed by surprise when attacked at home. This also applies to anyone who is a regular visitor to the place.

## Escape Route
You have an escape plan for your digs that no one would be able to predict was even possible. Like, seriously, who builds an escape hatch in the back of their fridge?  
**Cost:** 1 LP  

**Game Effect**  
If you need to get out of your place fast, and the doors and windows just aren’t good choices, you take option three and are able to escape without people knowing where you went. This should be discussed with the gamemaster about exactly how the runner gets away.

## Home Gym
Work out to improve physical skills and attributes, or just to vent stress. Just understand that most of your visitors are going to view the machine as a torture device.  
**Cost:** 2 LP  

**Game Effect**  
Halves the training time for improving any physical skill or attribute, see p. 69, SR6.

## Houseplants/Victory Garden
A little bit of green life in the home is a good thing—unless it is mold that is slowly turning black. This is really good when it is some herbs and spices that give a bit more taste to the food-like substances that the corps sell to the unwashed masses. Or, if you have an extra room, you can have an old-fashioned grow-op of fruits and vegetables (or more specialized, possibly less legal plants.)  
**Cost:** 2 LP / 4 LP  

**Game Effect**  
Houseplants: Calming and soothing, houseplants filter some of the pollutants from the air,


---


giving runners with pollution-based allergies a +2 to their dice pool to resist them while they’re at home. They also season up food nicely.

Victory Garden: Requires a spare room. Real fruit, real veggies, hydroponics worked for you! Herbs and spices, too! Shadowrunners with food-based allergies to the synthscop that the Corps peddle gain a +2 dice pool modifier to resist them.

## INCONSPICUOUS HOUSING

Something about your building makes it hard to find for anyone that hasn’t been there before, possibly even requiring a number of visits to get it down pat. While this makes getting deliveries there a pain in the hoop, it is also harder to find you when the Heat is on.  
**Cost:** 2 LP

**Game Effect**  
People attempting to locate the home with this quality through Legwork cannot spend Edge to do so.

## META-ACCOMMODATING

Dwarfs and trolls, along with their metavariants, have a hard time living in a world built for humans, while elves and orks are able to handle things, mostly. Then there are some metasapients who practically need custom pads built for them. You try getting a centaur up a five-story walk-up with all the groceries they need! Or find clothing in pixie-size that didn’t come from a Corpo-Carrie playset. On the bright side, for only a bit extra per month, your runner lucked out and found one of those rare places that accommodates their needs.  
**Cost:** 1 LP/2 LP

**Game Effect**  
At 1 LP, the apartment or house has been modified to fit a Dwarf, Troll, or Sasquatch’s needs, being shorter, or taller, than most places, and not being overbearing or insulting about it. At 2 LP, all of the other meta-sapients have found a place that is comfortable for them and their body shapes. Not having these will make living in the human-sized dump a lot trickier, and often involves falls from stepladders, damage to ceilings and the tops of doorways combined with headaches and the occasional concussion, to being given an action figure playset and told to live in it. It isn’t easy being non-human sized.

## PRIVACY SCREEN

Okay, yeah, the view of the building next door isn’t all that pleasant, but it makes it that much harder for observers to try to spy into your business while you’re relaxing at home in a bubble bath (don’t judge, it’s soothing!) With a little more investment and time before you move in, the landlord might throw in some wi-fi defeating measures.  
**Cost:** 2 LP/Level

**Game Effect**  
Level 1: The Perception dice pool to observe and view this location is reduced by 2.  
Level 2: In addition to the Perception penalty, the landlord has included wi-fi inhibiting wallpaper or paint, reducing any Electronics or Cracking dice pool directed at anyone or anything in the location by 2 as well. This includes attempting to get drones into the place.

## RELIABLE UTILITIES

You hit the jackpot here. Either the landlord knew who to bribe, or they have illegal taps redirecting energy from the better parts of the city. You don’t suffer the typical water or power rationing. Those long showers feel wonderfully wizard!  
**Cost:** 1 LP

**Game Effect**  
While the quality of water, cleanliness, or power remain the same, the quantity never ends! Handy when your ration time is only from 0500 — 0630.

## NEGATIVE QUALITIES

### AFFILIATION (GROUP)

Your home is affiliated with a certain group. Property management corporations, organized crime, policlubs, terrorists, a certain fixer, a dragon, whatever. You have to be careful to toe the line with them, or you might find yourself evicted.

Or “evicted” with a ship anchor chained around your body (feet in concrete don’t work so well—the knees give out far too soon.) This includes the company you keep, as your neighbors are all too interested in who you affiliate yourself with, if they’re an enemy, and have whatever “security” they’re connected with on speed-dial. Also, Humanis Policlub tenements and apartments tend to get firebombed. A lot.  
**Cost:** –1 LP/Level (maximum 3 levels)

**Game Effect**  
Neighbors’ Perception dice pools start at 4, and increase by +1 per additional Level, always seeing if you are keeping whatever rules have been established for this area.

## CORPORATE OWNED

If Affiliation wasn’t bad enough for you, then there’s this, which is far, far worse. The streets are


---


clean, the neighbors friendly, the lawns mowed by drones, the garbage and recycle bins put out in time. Beautiful houses and apartment buildings, and corp sec everywhere to make sure it stays that way. Welcome to living in a corporate enclave! Everything about you is being observed. Now, this will help your home food printer and kaf machine measure out the vitamins, minerals, and drugs needed to keep you calm and loyal, after scanning your piss and drek going into the toilet, but it’s tough on your street-level contacts visiting to watch the game.  
**Cost:** –2 LP

### Game Effect  
Only higher-end contacts (Connection Level 4+) can be invited over without undue problems; contacts with a lower Connection rating can visit, but their Loyalty is lowered by 1 to reflect the hassle they deal with getting to the place. And unless they look like corporate suits, your runner team will have an equally difficult time getting in.

## Crashpad  
No matter what locks and security systems you put into place, no matter how much you bribe the security goons at the entrance, no matter what traps and landmines you put around your place, *they* just get in. Who are they? The party people, of course! And the party is at your place, because it’s the party place! Everyone knows it’s the party place, no matter how much you object to it. Honestly, you wish you just had to deal with twelve dwarves and a wizard! Oh, and you’ll never get the smell of deepweed out of your clothing after they hotboxed the place by throwing kilos of the stuff into the oven and put it on bake. And baked is what everyone in the apartment certainly was!  
**Cost:** –2 LP

### Game Effect  
Your place got a reputation for being a party house, like, five tenants ago, and it never lost it. No matter what you try, you are never alone in your own home, even when you want to be. Especially when you want to be. And it’s a huge fight to get to your bed when there’s five naked people on it. You also get a lot of noise complaints, which means the cops show up frequently.

## Cursed Utilities  
No matter what your landlord and you do, the place just doesn’t work half the time. Power goes out, water comes out full of algae, the food printer is stuck on the flavor you absolutely hate, and the toilet flushes in the opposite direction than it should. And that doesn’t even include the water pipes threatening to kill you and eat your soul. At least, you hope it’s the water pipes.  
**Cost:** –2 LP

### Game Effect  
The place just gets on your nerves horribly. Also, the shower occasionally spits out blood instead of water, although it sometimes comes out of the kitchen sink. Every week, make a Willpower + Willpower (4) test, or end up Frightened (p. 52, *SR6*) for a full day as the haunting effects stick with you even after you leave the horrorshow.

## Hotel California  
This quality only applies to safehouses. You’re allowed in, but only allowed out at certain times. There are a variety of reasons for this, some of them even make sense. But the fact of the matter is, you’re locked down for a set amount of time determined by the master of the house. Inconvenient, but, hey, the cred off your stick is a bit lower.  
**Cost:** –3 LP

### Game Effect  
You’re locked in your room and can’t get out until a certain amount of time decided on by the gamemaster goes by. This is typically measured by weeks but is rarely more than a whole month. Expect to get cabin fever, and hope beyond hopes that they included enough entertainment—otherwise you’ll be reading *Catcher In The Rye* over and over again.

## Infestation  
You’ve tried a bug bomb, numerous traps, sticky tape, getting the neighborhood kids to hunt them for cred, and even going as far as to hire a legitimate exterminator, but your place remains infested with paracritters. Nothing works, and they’re getting worse. Much worse. You have a hard time sleeping, wondering if they’re a hive mind planning on using their abilities to take over your mind or eat your soul.  
**Cost:** –1 LP/level

### Game Effect  
Level 1: Welcome to Roachville, population, 10,000 roaches and one metahuman. These Awakened cockroaches are immune to whatever you throw at them, including combat boots. They just squish, crawl out, and shake themselves off. They’re everywhere when the lights are off, working hard to get the lightbulbs out of the sockets so you can’t turn those lights back on.  
Level 2: Insects are bad, but the rats are worse. You have to work hard to keep them out of your food stores, and you’re pretty sure they


---


have some nasty diseases if you get bitten. Hope your street doc’s inoculations aren’t too expired. They sprinkle the rat poison you spread around as a spice and laugh at you in the middle of the night.  
Level 3: Devil rats, maybe even a demon rat or two. Yeah, they own this place now, and you’re their guest.

## LACKLUSTER SECURITY  
Either they’re paying these security goons too much for the pathetic service they give, or they’re not paying them enough to give a devil rat’s ass. What this means to you is that there is a longer wait for any kind of emergency services; DocWagon teams arrive just before the maximum time required by your service contract.  
**Cost:** –2 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
Response to any kind of emergency by officials or the local gang are doubled.

## LEAKY FAUCET  
You’re almost used to it, that noise that happens just when you start to drift off to sleep. It’s a headache-inducing horror of a noise, and you can’t figure out where it is coming from—or even what it is. Somehow, it even gets past white noise generators, ear plugs, headphones blaring music, and even select sound filters.  
**Cost:** –2 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
Make a Body + Willpower (4) test. If you succeed, you just barely get enough sleep. If not, you have the Fatigue I status (p. 52, SR6). The level of Fatigue increases if you fail additional tests.

## LOW POWER  
Maybe there was once a decent power supply for this place, but it’s been improperly maintained and now only works sporadically. Every time you turn on a device, you say a quick prayer in the hope it will have the juice it needs.  
**Cost:** –1 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
Just when you need the electricity to work, it doesn’t. You lose wi-fi connectivity for all electronics, the trid player doesn’t work, and you have to eat your NutriSoy out of the container like some neanderthal with the horrible tasting plasteel spoon.

## MR. JOHNSON'S NEIGHBORHOOD  
A Mr. Johnson, fixer, or some other contact that knows the real estate game helped you get your place. Sure, you got a good deal on it, but having someone else that knows where you sleep? Better not slot them off.  
**Cost:** –3 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
Whoever helped you get your place doesn’t have to hunt for you if you have made an enemy of them. They just go right for the jugular.

## NOT A HOME  
This quality is typically found in boltholes rather than in a spot for regular daily living, as this place is not designed to be lived in for a long period of time. It might not be designed to be lived in for a short period of time, either. A chemical camping toilet rather than a flush model, bottled water and no water drain, and no shower or tub. Oh, and your food is “Pop’n’Heat” rations from the 2050s, in none of the flavors you actually like. Certainly no laundry facilities.  
**Cost:** –3 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
You take a –2 dice pool modifier to Social and Natural Recovery tests while living here, since you’re dirty, you stink, and are just otherwise nasty. Note: Street and Squatter levels of Necessities already have this quality built in, so they cannot take it.

## PRIVACY INVASION  
Some places are great for keeping the looky-loos from observing you. This place isn’t one of those. No matter how you drape the curtains, no matter what wi-fi defeating systems you put into place, you’re on view for the entire neighborhood. Hope you put on clean underwear.  
**Cost:** –1 LP  

**GAME EFFECT**  
Attempts to observe a character while in their home gain a bonus point of Edge.

## SPOUSE  
You went and done it—you took a bullet to the knee and tied the knot. You’re married! While there is a lot of benefits to having a spouse, there is one problem: They don’t know you’re a shadowrunner. And they’re sure to divorce you, at minimum, if they catch you and your chummers doing shadow stuff in your home. They’re certainly going to be concerned when you get home with a

bloody shot-up car, bloody shot-up body armor, and bloody shot-up body!  
**Cost:** –3 LP

### Game Effect  
If you’re caught doing illegal stuff by your spouse, divorce is extremely likely, which will break any fake SIN. They might also call the cops on you as well—depends on what they catch you doing, and how far love goes.

## THRIFTY  
Your landlord never met a sale they couldn’t walk away from. Problem is, that stuff was cheap for a reason. Knock-off is the best you can hope for when it comes to the facilities and appliances in your place. The refrigerator makes things hot, the oven makes things cold, the shower head might as well be a bare hose, and the kaf maker—well, the less said about the kaf maker, the better.  
**Cost:** –1 LP

### Game Effect  
Unless you replace or repair the equipment in your place yourself, things break all the time. And the landlord never learns their lesson about getting cheap drek that is just drek and conks out whenever it wants to.

# A MOST FALSE IMPOSITION

The core rules for *SR6* includes the basic rules for Reputation and Heat, and this chapter adds to them by providing rules to deal with multiple factions. Reputation can be tracked as a single axis representing two different factions (see p. 235, *SR6*) or can use multiple trackers for each individual faction in the game. Heat and heat modifiers can represent a single representation of how much trouble they’ve earned or track based on individual jurisdictions as the runners move between different corp- and government-controlled spaces.

For those that have the *Shadowrun, Sixth World* Gamemaster’s Screen, this can be tracked using the Heat Modifier tracker (–5 to +4) and the ten faction Reputation trackers (–2 to +2) on the back of the screen. If you don’t have this screen, tokens in front of the gamemaster can be used to help players remember their reputation, and also serve as a gentle reminder as their Heat Modifier starts to climb.

While a city is going to have a large number of factions at play from small, street-level gangs and communities up to the megacorps and governments, a campaign is likely only going to touch on four to five factions that are relevant to the story and the runner team. Because of this, the ten trackers on the shield can be also used for Reputation with individuals or used to keep track of factional Heat.

## RUNNING HEAT WITH MULTIPLE FACTIONS

Any good city worth its cred is a mishmash of areas controlled by competing megacorps, gangs, and the general public. Each of those areas are going to be policed by different groups. Whether those groups work together and share information in order to bring down the criminally minded shadowrunner is going to vary based on how friendly those factions are with each other. Those different jurisdictions are going to have different amounts of cameras, sensors, drones, and guards.



---


For instance, a runner team has an extraction they need to complete in Neo-Tokyo. The team knows they are going to be operating in Shinjuku, which is an AA security zone and also a region controlled by the Mita-gumi of the Yakuza. Once they have picked up the target, they need to deliver the target to Aneki Island, which is controlled by Renraku. The trip passes through either a B security zone or via an AA security zone, depending on the route, with different Yakuza clans controlling the territory. If the team decides to not make deals with each of the Yakuza groups they are moving through, that increases the risk. In addition, operating initially in Shinjuku means they are being picked up by the cameras and sensors run by the Neo-Tokyo Metropolitan Police. When they get to Aneki Island, they are monitored by the Renraku security division.

As the players move through different security zones in the city, the chance of them getting picked up by a stray camera or having someone see them entering a facility varies with the security zone rating. The higher the rating, the more likely they are to get spotted while working. Even operating under concealment, there is that chance that a spirit or watcher spots their aura moving through the area, or some spider detects their Matrix devices. Operating on AAA megacorporation property is the same as operating in an AAA security zone, and working on AA corporation property brings the same Heat Modifier as an AA security zone.

When runners move from one security zone to another, knowledge may be shared depending on the company running security in each region and whether any criminal organizations share information across territories. If the Watada-rengo are managing adjacent territories under different families, they are likely going to talk to each other as runners move between the two regions. If it is rival clans, such as the Mita-gumi and the Inagawa-kai, then moving between different territories is a great way to lower the risk.

On a run, track the individual factions controlling the territory where the runners are working. At the end of the run, roll 2D6 for each of the factions as per the rules on p. 236, *SR6*. Each faction has its own Heat score for the runners. When a team’s Heat with a single faction reaches a multiple of 10, such as moving from 9 to 10 or 19 to 20, all other factions’ Heat increases by 1.

While Heat is tracked individually, when operating on a run the Heat of the team is based on the highest Heat score of all runners. So if Poindexter, Sunrise, and Teller have 4 Heat each, but Skeev the rat shaman has a Heat score of 6, the overall team Heat for the run is 6. Similarly, the team calculates its Heat for each faction-controlled area using the highest runner’s Heat score for that faction.

## FACTIONS AND REPUTATION

Factions such as gangs, corps, and organizations all work on their own goals and agendas. As a runner, you are at the beck and call of whoever gives you the job. So while you might want a killer rep with a group, sometimes those jobs just don’t come in. While working a job for Mr. Johnson from S-K is the easiest way to build a solid reputation with Herr Brackhaus, there are other ways to show that you are solid and dependable. For instance, the team happens across a new prototype commlink while making a run against Erika. Instead, they could sell this information to S-K and gain a point of Reputation with the megacorp.

The different types of factions generally fall into some pretty common themes with how a team could gain or lose Reputation. Megacorporations ultimately care about the bottom line. If you are on

A run against a megacorporation, you are likely to lose face with them if you are caught. If you gain Heat with a faction, you also lose a point of Reputation with that faction. You will lose additional Reputation if you kill workers, destroy property, or any action that hurts their profitability.

The reverse is also true. If you take actions that increase profitability or align with corporate goals, you will earn Reputation. This could be anything from completing the job early to providing paydata free or at a reduced cost. Completing the job in an exemplary way will also net you a bump in Reputation, whether that means completing optional objectives or getting it done without leaving a trace.

Dealing with gangs or organized crime factions has its own way of building a solid Reputation. While the team’s ability to positively or negatively impact the bottom line also impacts the gangs, there are some other activities or behaviors that will get you on the good side of a gang. Dealing with the Halloweeners? May-


---


be adding a bit of explosives to the mix when you shake down a rival gang will earn you more points of Reputation. If you are working with the Yakuza, stomping all over tradition is likely going to lose you a point of Reputation, depending on some of the internal politics.

Factions that are community groups, magical groups, or even groups of shadowrunners are going to have their own codes of honor and strictures that they are following. Knowing the strictures of the group is going to be key for the team to understand if they are building rep or tearing it down. Doing a job for the proponents of Prop 37, which means to increase the penalty of metaracist hate crimes, could be operating completely under a no-violence stricture or one that encourages violence against hate groups. Knowing which is which could mean more work for the team.

Once the gamemaster has selected the right number of factions in the game, ranging from street level to the upper echelons of society, they will need to track the Reputation with all of them. The team’s Reputation is not capped, though the score represented in the faction sliders matches the Edge bonus they can gain with that faction. When a team reaches +10 with a faction, they gain +1 Edge at the beginning of a social interaction with members of that faction (p. 235, *SR6*). When the team reaches –20 or +20, the benefit becomes 2 points of Edge at the start of a social interaction. The Edge benefit from Reputation for multiple factions can be tracked on the *Shadowrun* Gamemaster’s Screen front panel.

In the cases where team members have different Reputation, the score of the member that is the furthest away from 0 Reputation is used. If Orbital Burn has a reputation of 11 with MCT, but Lowkey has a reputation of –13 with them, then the –13 is used; during the social encounter, MCT members gain +1 Edge at the beginning of the scene.

## Gear, Heat, and Rep

A shadowrunner trying to either buy or sell gear will find that their Reputation and Heat will impact how easy it is to move products. When goods are rarer or more traceable, contacts are going to be more cautious about moving those products because they don’t want that heat to fall on them if the gear is used in a crime. If the contact is willing to go out on a limb for you or if you drop some extra nuyen their way, they may be willing to help you get that fancy new drug that requires a license or the sweet Crackshot Arms Roaring Thunder.

----

### Reputation Outside of a Run

Building your Reputation doesn’t end when you are off the clock. Runners can spend their downtime working for factions to help improve their standing with them. When those downtime activities match the goals and values of the faction, your Reputation can improve through the expenditure of some Karma or nuyen. This could be as simple as throwing a party with all the right people there so that your contacts in the company or gang can hobnob. Or as complex as organizing a team to steal something for you to give to your contacts over there. No matter what, gaining rep isn’t free.

Runners can spend 1,000 nuyen × the new Reputation level plus an additional 1 Karma to make the change. For instance, to go from Reputation 4 to Reputation 5 with Ares, a runner can spend 5,000 nuyen and 1 Karma. This only raises the Reputation of the individual who is spending the nuyen and Karma. It generally takes two weeks to organize and execute the party, charity function, or run. When your Reputation is negative with a faction, the cost is based on the positive value of your current reputation. For example, if you have a –12 Reputation with the Desolation Angels and want to organize a soup kitchen in their territory to get on their good graces, it will cost 12,000 nuyen and 1 Karma to raise the Reputation to –11.

Word gets around when you are using your downtime and personal funds to help out a faction. If two factions are opposed and are in a current fight in the shadows, then you lose 1 Reputation with the opposition faction.

----

### Reputation and Jobs

Once there is a list of factions in play, a team’s Reputation impacts whether they are going to get the call first or if another team of shadowrunners gets the first shot at the job. Optionally, if you are rolling 2D6 to determine the number of days between runs before a faction gives a team a call, subtract the team’s Reputation from the result to see how often they are getting called by a given faction. For example, assume the team has just completed a run for MCT and they have 3 Reputation with them. The gamemaster rolls 2D6 and gets ten days until the next call comes in from MCT for a job. But with 3 Reputation, the wait is reduced, and the call comes in seven days after they have completed the run.

In addition, having a great Reputation with a faction means they are more likely to start the negotiation higher, instead of lowballing you because you are an unknown. The maximum payout for the job doesn’t change, because there is only so much of a budget to spend on deniable assets, but at least you are starting from a higher point. The initial offer increases by one percent per point of Reputation with the faction, up to a maximum of ten percent, and any additional Reputation moves one percent of the pay to an initial payment. For example, assume a team has 15 Reputation with the Draco Foundation and would normally be offered 40,000 nuyen to retrieve an artifact. Due to their Reputation, they are instead offered 44,000 nuyen with 2,200 nuyen of that upfront.

# Fencing Gear

Fencing gear doesn’t require a specialist, but specialists are likely to have the best chance of moving certain types of gear and are the most likely to give you a good price. Selling your old cyberware to a street doc is going to net you more nuyen than if you use your fixer, smuggler, or fence. A specialist is able to move gear that has an availability that is 1 higher than normal. The black-market arms dealer with an effective Connection rating of 4 is able to sell gear that is Availability 4I whereas a Connection 4 fence is only able to move gear that is Availability 3 or less.

But just because they are able to sell the product for you doesn’t mean that they are going to. The runner makes an Influence (Charisma-based or Logic-based) Opposed test. If the runner is successful, the fence is willing to sell the item for you. They will pay you ten percent of the list price plus one percent for each net hit, with a maximum of (Loyalty – Heat) hits applied. For instance, Bama “found” a crate of firearms on a recent run and wants to work with her old quartermaster to move the gear. Bama currently has Loyalty 6 with the quartermaster but also 3 Heat. Bama scores 4 net hits with the quartermaster but is limited to using 3 those hits because of the amount of heat currently on her, netting her thirteen percent of the value of the gear.

Selling gear that the team picks up doesn’t come without risk. The gear can be traced, and moving a lot of gear will raise the suspicions of authorities and make it easier for them to track the runners. For every 1,000 nuyen gained through fencing gear, the specific runner selling the gear gains +1 Heat modifier. If the runners glitch the Influence test, the runners gain an additional point of Heat. If the runners critically glitch the Influence test, the runners are caught in a raid by the police and are issued a Criminal SIN; the item they were trying to sell is lost. If you are using factions and jurisdictions for Heat, use the faction that represents police for local municipality faction, such as Lone Star for Seattle.

Some items are going to hurt your Reputation by selling them. Harvesting bioware, cyberware, or body parts to fence is frowned upon by just about everyone except maybe Tamanous or the Disassemblers. If the runners are selling any bioware, cyberware, or body parts that didn’t come from their own bodies, they suffer a Reputation loss of 1.

## Buying Gear

Most of the time, it is pretty easy to do a Matrix search and find the gear that you want from Kong-Wal Mart or Stuffer Shack. But for those items that are illegal or outside the scope of your licenses, you need to work your connections to get it smuggled to you. Typically, that type of gear will draw attention from the authorities. When runners have heat on them, their contacts are going to be a little hesitant to sell to them in case some of that heat blows back onto them.

If the runners are using one of their contacts, their contact can get anything whose Availability is less than their effective Connection rating. But if the Heat score for the individual runner is greater than their Loyalty with the contact, the contact isn’t going to want to help them out for fear of blowback. The team can buy the item at an increased price where each point that Heat exceeds Loyalty increases the price by ten percent over list price. The runners can also add nuyen to the mix to help the contact find the gear. For every fifty percent increase in the cost of the goods, the Contact can find goods with 1 higher Availability than they normally could.

> ### Buying Gear Example
>
> Skeev the rat shaman has a talismonger contact who is Connection 3 and Loyalty 4. Skeev and his team currently have a Heat score of 6 with the local Lone Star Seattle police. The shaman has been saving up nuyen to buy a spirit focus (Force 4) and he doesn’t want to go through and get a license for it because his fake SINs are not in great shape, and he doesn’t need the tracking of his activities that often come with such a license.
>
> He wants to use his talismonger instead of his fixer because his fixer charges a ten percent finder’s fee and also isn’t as loyal as his talismonger is. Skeev reaches out to the talismonger and is told that he is asking for something that is way outside what he can acquire. Since Skeev has 2 more Heat than Loyalty, he needs to pay an additional twenty percent to make it worth the talismonger’s time. He also needs to pay an extra one hundred percent to bridge the gap so that the Connection 3 talismonger can find the Availability 4L focus. Skeev decides that it’s worth it, and he pays his talismonger 36,800 nuyen.

Having a positive Reputation with a given faction will help you find gear that they make. That positive rep makes it easier for a contact who either works for the manufacturer or is heavily connected to them to convince the company that it is good for business to have a fancy Krime Thumper fall off the back of a truck and wind up in the hands of a team of runners who have done good work for the corp. If the runners call a contact affiliated with a corporation, they can buy gear created by that corporation where the Availability is reduced by (Reputation / 5, rounded down). For instance, the team wants to buy five cryo grenades from Ares, and they have a contact with the company along with a positive Reputation of 6. This changes the Availability by (6 / 5), which is rounded down to one, meaning the Availability changes from 5(I) to 4(I).



---


But what if the team is in a rush? They can have an appropriate contact make a Connection + Connection (Availability) test to determine if the contact is able to get the item in the next hour. The team can pay extra to provide the contact with some additional buying power. For each twenty-five percent increase, the contact gains 1 additional die (up to their Connection rating). If the contact is successful, the team can buy the item for the price plus ten percent for each point of Heat they have and additional money spent to help acquire the goods.

### EXPRESS BUYING GEAR EXAMPLE

Sunrise is looking to pick up an Ingram Grey Knight while on a run because he discovered that they needed the extra firepower. He reaches out to his smuggler friend to see if they can get the gear he needs right away. The team currently has 3 Heat, and the gun smuggler is Connection 4. The smuggler makes a 4 + 4 (5) test to acquire the item—a test where success is pretty unlikely. So they decide to spend an additional one hundred percent to give the contact an extra 4 dice. The contact would then roll 12 dice to attempt to get 5 successes. The gun smuggler tries their luck, and success! But looking at the price right now, the team will have to pay an additional one hundred thirty percent to buy the item because of the Heat and the extra buying power. The team ends up paying 17,250 nuyen for the gun. Now they just need to get their hands on some ammo.

### GREASING THE WHEELS

Sometimes you want to provide a bribe during a run to help deal with any potential Heat. After a run, you can spend 1,000 nuyen to reduce Heat, but in this case, you are trying to spend money negating any Heat modifier in the current run or even in the current scene. For instance, you may be breaking into a store in one of the megamalls at an arcology. You have decided the best way in is to enter the service tunnels from one of the twenty-four-hour taco places. A well-placed bribe of twenty-five nuyen gets you a keycard and access from the local teenager who works the counter. This reduces the likelihood of getting connected to the crime, as you can move quicker through the back tunnels. The team could bribe the spider running the host security to wipe footage or do it themselves. Each of these smaller bribes helps reduce the footprint of detection that the team goes through on a run.

But what happens when it goes sideways? You have the keycard, and as you enter the back tunnels, you encounter an automated security drone patrolling the passageways—and you flub the encounter. How does this impact your previously placed bribe to the teenager and to the spider? If you bribed the spider enough, this would be handled, because the drone would either ignore the team or the team would have routes that avoided the security drone. This really comes down to whether the team has paid a sufficient amount of nuyen to sufficiently reduce their footprint. While twenty-five nuyen was perfect for the teenager, the spider is going to take more nuyen.

Spending 1,000 nuyen should reduce 1 point of Heat for a single individual. Spending bribes during the run reduces the chance of the team gaining Heat during the run. To reduce the Heat Modifier, the bribe should be greater than 500 nuyen, but less than 3,000 nuyen, which affects the whole team, not just an individual runner.

When dealing with Heat per faction or jurisdiction, the bribe would apply to the appropriate faction. So in the example of working in the back hallways of a mall, the mall is owned by Horizon. This means any bribes would help with any potential Heat gain with Horizon security but would have no impact with Lone Star, who handles patrols outside of the arcology.

### GANGS, CORPORATE, MILITARY, OR SECRET SOCIETIES CAMPAIGNS

Heat and Reputation don’t work the same in campaigns with military, gangs, or corporate troubleshooter themes. Reputation within the affiliated company, gang, or crew is more important than other factions outside of the group. The team’s Heat is affected where the larger group is able to calm things down or make things worse based on their connections. And the acquisition of gear or equipment is about requisitioning from the company or group instead of bringing your equipment to the party.

In a gang campaign, the number of factions inside the gang isn’t going to match what you would see in a military or corporate campaign. Instead, Reputation is driven by the territory the gang controls and is ultimately tied to the gang’s Reputation. The Reputation of the gang and team allows them to make bigger deals to help the gang. In these campaigns, Reputation growth is slower, and only occurs when the whole gang is able to control more territory or more of an illicit trade. Making bigger deals can only occur when the gang’s Reputation exceeds the Influence of the group they are trying to make a deal with.

Every megacorporation has a group of elite units that sometimes operate off the books doing things the corporations can’t or don’t want to be known to other parties, especially untrustworthy shadowrunners. In a corporate setting, the runners

// A MOST FALSE IMPOSITION

will operate out of a division or department. Most runs or missions will have targets outside of the company, but there may be some internal runs. Because most runs are going to come from the same central lead figure of the department or division, it is easier to gain Reputation inside your department than with other factions. Gains in Reputation with other factions, such as other departments or outside the company, come from two primary places. The first place is to find useful paydata on runs and share that with other divisions or organizations, thus earning them Reputation with those groups. The second place that teams can earn more Reputation is seeking out secondary objectives from other teams or departments or if the run is sponsored by another department.

Military can be a range of elements, including standard trained soldiers, special forces, and mercenary units. Though part of a much larger unit, any of them can be broken down in much smaller units, possibly as small as ten people strong. Runners will take their orders from an officer within the unit. In these campaigns, when your gunny said, “do your job, soldier,” completing the mission provides the easiest way to build a solid Reputation. Secondary Reputation within the unit can be increased by showing acts of bravery, saving a fellow member’s life or improvised tactics to neutralize a situation. Gaining Reputation outside the unit is easiest with the faction that hired the unit but could also come by saving a wealthy business owner’s family member or other unique situations.

For a secret society campaign, the game starts within such an organization, and then the runners are introduced to a hidden faction within the larger group. The runners may have normal lives similar to the Grey Cell membership (p. 48, *Collapsing Now*) or may live completely within the society’s compound. While their orders for a run come from the wider organization, the secret society will have additional objectives. The person they deal with will change as the runners’ Reputation increases within the organization. Additionally, Reputation may be gained by protecting the secrecy of the cell or eliminating competition. Because secret societies have to use other organizations when dealing with the public, it is possible for runners to gain or lose Reputation with other outside groups when acting for the secret society.

In a corporate, military, or secret society campaign, Heat is divided between internal Heat with respect to the company or organization versus outside-the-organization Heat. For Heat outside the organization, the rules match those of a standard campaign with jurisdiction-level Heat based on where the team is operating. When a team would gain external Heat, they can choose instead to gain internal Heat. Internal Heat represents the amount of trouble the team is getting into within the internal politics. Is the team giving the division a

A MOST FALSE IMPOSITION //


---


bad reputation? Is it getting just too expensive to keep the team on the payroll? For every 5 Heat, the team’s Reputation drops by 1. When the team hits 20 Heat, there is an internal contract to eliminate the team, and all missions they are sent on receive less support in terms of requisition of materials and gear.

For gang campaigns, Heat is accrued the same as jurisdiction-based Heat rules. In a gang campaign, the gang can spend 1 Reputation to reduce Heat by 5. This represents the loss of an illicit trade or burning a connection with another group. Gear and equipment is really about what you can find, steal, or buy.

For a corporate or military campaign, gear is assigned as part of the mission. In the case that the teams wants to requisition additional gear, they can make an Influence test versus the group’s quartermaster or corporate financial department. Those employees have not been successful in this position by letting just anyone gain any gear they want and will have strong mental attributes. When making the test, the team gains +1 Edge for Reputation between 10–19 and +2 Edge for Reputation above 20. The quartermaster or finance department gains a dice pool modification equal to the Availability of the gear and +1 Edge for team Heat between 10–19 and +2 Edge for Heat above 20.

If the secret society is structured using cells or subsects, the runner can appease another section they have upset by attempting a secondary objective on the mission. If the secondary objective is completed, all runners involved that know about it reduce their Heat by 1. However, if anyone in their section or in the wider organization discovers the acceptance or completion of the secondary objective, the Heat of all runners involved increases by 1 with their section.

  
// A MOST FALSE IMPOSITION

# ANATOMY OF A SHADOWRUN

> To help show how the rules of *Shadowrun, Sixth World* work, especially when it comes to gaining and using Edge, this chapter presents a short scene from a run, along with explanations of how the game rules would be used in that situation.


---


# SECTION 1

### GAME PLAY

The scene here is a simple one. Two runners, a troll named Claret and a human named Leadfield, are questioning a ganger named Two-Stroke in an abandoned store while a dwarf decker named Piaffe does some Matrix overwatch nearby.

The interrogation has to move fast, as the runners are trying to track a shipment that is probably already on its way out of town. The shipment is some drugs that Two-Stroke’s gang has lifted from the back of a talismonger’s shop. Two-Stroke knew someone might come along to track the goods, but he didn’t know they would be as large as Claret, which is making him nervous. Claret tries to seize on this, pounding the walls and yelling that Two-Stroke better share what he knows. Two-Stroke looks nervous but doesn’t break. Claret changes his approach, trying to buy information out of Two-Stroke, but the ganger still doesn’t bend or give any useful information.

### GAME RULES

For the purposes of this example, we’ll use character stats from the *Shadowrun, Sixth World* core rulebook. Claret is a street samurai (p. 87, *SR6*), Leadfield is a street shaman (p. 88, *SR6*, with the Increase Reflexes Spell added), Piaffe is a decker (p. 84, *SR6*), and Two-Stroke is a Sons of Sauron Brute (p. 205, *SR6*).

In the initial step of the story, Claret is trying to intimidate the ganger. The ganger has been warned about people like Claret, which would give him a point of situational Edge according to the table on p. 98, *SR6*. However, as an ork, Claret is more physically powerful than the ganger, which would normally give her Edge. These two situations cancel each other out, so no Edge is distributed.

This is an Influence test, and it will be linked to Charisma, since Claret is not making a purely logical argument. This means it is opposed by Willpower + Intuition. Claret, sadly, does not have the Influence skill, so she is left to roll Charisma – 1. With a Charisma of 2, she only rolls a single die, while Two-Stroke rolls 4 to resist. Claret gets no hits, while Two-Stroke gets 1, so the ganger is not intimidated. The attempted bribe doesn’t change the Edge dynamic, and once again Claret’s single die versus Two-Stroke’s four fails to carry the day.

# SECTION 2

### GAME PLAY

Piaffe, monitoring Matrix traffic, sees a reason that Two-Stroke is able to bear up to Claret’s intimidation—he got a message that help is on the way. Piaffe lets the others know that they need to be ready for some company.

### GAME RULES

To keep an eye in the communications going to Two-Stroke’s commlink, Piaffe needs Admin-level access (see Snoop, p. 184, *SR6*). He decided he had time to Probe his way into the commlink. Two-Stroke’s commlink is device rating 2, which gives it a Firewall of 1. Two-Stroke’s Intuition, the other part of his defense roll, is 2. For his part, Piaffe has Cracking 7 and Logic 6, so he rolls 13 dice on his Probe action. He rolls 4 hits on his first attempt, compared to Two-Stroke’s single hit. Piaffe gets User access as well as an OS of 1 from Two-Stroke’s hit. He rolls again to get Admin access and gets 3 hits, while Two-Stroke gets 2 hits. That increases the OS by 3–2 for the hits on the defense roll, and 1 more because he is maintaining illegal access. His OS stands at 4.

When the message is sent to Two-Stroke, the gamemaster has Piaffe roll a Snoop action, which is also Cracking + Logic. Two-Stroke rolls Logic + Firewall, which is 2 dice. Two-Stroke rolls no hits, while Piaffe gets 4. Since he still has illegal access, 1 is added to the OS, but no more additions on this test from the opposed hits, so the OS now stands at 5. More importantly, Piaffe has the message that was sent to Two-Stroke.



---


## SECTION 3

### GAME PLAY  
Claret and Leadfield move quickly. Claret ties down Two-Stroke to keep him from interfering in the upcoming fight, while Leadfield casts Increase Reflexes on himself to help him move quickly in the upcoming fight. He then moves toward the back of the small building.

### GAME RULES  
The gamemaster rules that Two-Stroke does not resist the effort to apply disposable plastic restraints, so no test is required.  
Leadfield casts Increase Reflexes on himself by rolling Sorcery + Magic, which gives him 14 dice (the Spellcasting specialization helps him out here). He gets 4 hits, and since his Essence is 6, he can choose to apply all 4 hits. In the interest of avoiding severe drain, he chooses to apply 3 hits. That increases his Reaction by 3 (making it 5) and gives him a total of 4 initiative dice. The base drain of the spell is 5, and it increases by 2 thanks to every net hit applied after the first. So Leadfield rolls Willpower + Logic, or 10 dice, to avoid 7 points of drain. He rolls well, getting 5 hits, so he takes 2 points of damage. Since those 2 points are less than his Magic rating of 6, the damage is Stun.

## SECTION 4

### GAME PLAY  
Piaffe moves to a more secure location where he can monitor what’s happening while hopefully avoiding gunfire. No sooner is he secured than he reports that five gangers are approaching the building where Claret and Leadfield are holed up. These gangers clearly believe there is safety in numbers—they all have pistols out, and they are prepared to fire as one at any target that shows itself.

### GAME RULES  
As he moves to secure location, Piaffe makes a Perception + Intuition test, rolling 9 dice. He gets 2 hits. The gamemaster rules that the gangers are not being subtle in approaching the building, so Piaffe notices them coming and warns the others.  
At this point, the gamemaster asks the players to roll initiative. Leadfield has 4 dice and rolls a 17; adding that to his adjusted Initiative Score of 8 gives him a 25. Claret rolls 2 dice and gets 6, giving her a total of 14, while Piaffe rolls a single die and gets a 4, which gives him a total 11.  
The gamemaster treats the five gangers as a grunt group. They roll initiative as normal—rolling 1 die, getting a 5, for a total of 9. That mean initiative order goes like this:

| Character  | Initiative Total |
|------------|------------------|
| Leadfield  | 25               |
| Claret     | 14               |
| Piaffe     | 11               |
| Gangers    | 9                |



---


# SECTION 5

### GAME PLAY  
Leadfield, at the back of the shop, wants to get the high ground—hopefully without being noticed. He tries to quietly step up on a dumpster, using that to climb onto the roof and sneak forward without being noticed.

### GAME RULES  
Leadfield has 1 Major Action and 5 Minor, thanks to his Increase Reflexes spell. The gamemaster rules that the maneuver to quickly climb on the dumpster and get in the roof requires an Athletics + Agility (2) test. He only has 4 dice for the test; he rolls and gets 1 hit. Worried that he might need more, he spends 1 of his 7 Edge to re-roll one die. This time, it comes up with a 5—he has his second hit. Since that action required a test, it was a Major Action.  
Sneaking to the front of the roof will also require a test, so it’s a Major Action as well. Leadfield trades 4 of his Minor Actions to get one more Major Action. He rolls Stealth + Agility as he moves, but since he doesn’t have Stealth, that becomes Agility – 1. He rolls 2 dice and gets a single hit. He hopes that will do. He has one more Minor Action, but since he’s where he wants to be, he defers his action in case he needs it later.

# SECTION 6

### GAME PLAY  
Claret stands near the broken front window of the store, using the wall as partial cover. He turns and fires his shotgun out the window, catching the lead ganger.

### GAME RULES  
Now Claret’s going to fire. The gangers are within 50 meters, so it’s Near range—the perfect range for her Mossberg. She decides to try to hit two gangers at once, using Burst Fire mode and firing at two targets, splitting her dice pool between them. The Attack Rating at this range is 11, while the gangers have a Defense Rating of 4. That’s a difference of more than 4, so that’s a point of Edge to Claret! Her pool is Firearms + Agility, which is 10 dice, but that doesn’t feel large enough to her if she is going to divide it in two. She goes for the 4-Edge boost of adding her Edge rating of 5 to her dice pool. That gives her a dice pool of 15, which becomes a pool of 7 and a pool of 8. The pool of 7 dice does poorly—only 1 hit. The pool of 8 gets 2 hits, but both are 6s, so she can roll them again to get more hits. She gets 1 more, for a total of 3.  
The gamemaster rolls a single defense test of 4 dice for the gangers. They get 1 hit. That means the dice pool of 7 missed, but the dice pool of 8 got 2 net hits. The base damage of the Mossberg is 4P, increased to 6P by the 2 net hits. The gamemaster rolls 3 dice for the Body of the gangers and gets 1 hit, reducing the damage to 5P. The grunts have a single condition monitor of 10 boxes, and the hit fills up 5 of them for one ganger.



---


# SECTION 7

### GAME PLAY  
The gangers respond in kind, letting loose a barrage of bullets and hitting some of Claret’s flesh.

### GAME RULES  
Now it’s the gangers’ turn. They fire their Beretta 101Ts as one. The Attack Rating at Near range would normally be 8, but the four extra gangers boost that to 12 (more bullets are harder to avoid). Still, that 12 is well under Claret’s Defense Rating of 16—she gets another point of Edge!  
The third and the fifth ganger add attack dice according to the Grunt Group rules (p. 114, *SR6*), so the gangers will get 2 extra dice. Their pool for the attack is now 7, while Claret rolls 8 dice in defense. The attackers get 2 hits, while Claret gets none—and she critically glitches! That won’t do at all. She had 1 Edge left after her attack, and she gained one more thanks to her superior Defense Rating. She decides to spend those two Edge to add one to a die roll. She makes a 1 into a 2—thereby avoiding the glitch!  
Still, she has damage coming in. The base damage is 2P, raised to 4P by the 2 net hits. She rolls her Body of 7 and comes away with 2 hits—reducing the damage to 2P. She marks that off in her condition monitor.

# SECTION 8

### GAME PLAY  
Piaffe, in his secure location, does what hackers do—he gains access to one of the ganger’s commlinks. You never know when you’re going to need it! He knows he can Brute Force his way in, since he figures ganger cybersecurity is probably pretty poor.

### GAME RULES  
On Piaffe’s turn, he attempts a Brute Force hack on one of the ganger’s commlinks. He smartly hacks into one of the non-wounded ganger’s devices, figuring the one who is already shot might not make it out of the fight, thus making access to his device potentially less useful. He goes straight for Admin access, rolling Cracking 7 + Logic 6 against the gangers Willpower 2 + Firewall 1 + 2 for trying to get Admin access. Piaffe gets 4 hits to the ganger’s 2—he’s in! His OS goes up 3 more, so it sits at 8.



---


# SECTION 9

### GAME PLAY  
The gangers are focused on Claret, since the troll already shot one of them, so they don’t notice Leadfield standing up on the roof of the building and preparing to rain spells down on them. Leadfield hits them with a savage Fireball that saps some of his energy but packs a good wallop on the gangers.

### GAME RULES  
We now cycle back to the top of the initiative order, so Leadfield gets a turn. He casts a Fireball. The gangers are close enough together that he does not need to extend the range, but does he want to amp up the damage? The base drain value of the spell is 6, which is already pretty high, but he decides he wants to make an impression. He adds 1 to the base damage, increasing the drain to 8.  
He rolls Sorcery + Magic—14 dice—and gets 6 hits. He rolls 10 dice to resist drain and gets 4 hits. That means 4 more points of Stun damage will be added to the 2 he already has, filling up two rows of the condition monitor. He’ll have –2 dice on any tests until he heals!  
Now we need to see what the Fireball does. The gamemaster rolls Reaction + Willpower for the gangers, getting only 1 hit. The base damage is 3 (half of Leadfield’s Magic) + 5 (net hits) + 1 (Amp Up damage) or 9. The gangers roll their Body of 3 to resist the damage, getting 2 hits. That’s 7 damage inflicted on each of them. Since one ganger already had 5 damage thanks to Claret’s shotgun, they go down, unconscious. The others are severely wounded.

# SECTION 10

### GAME PLAY  
The gangers were not prepared for an onslaught like this. They decide they need better position—like, perhaps one a few kilometers away.

### GAME RULES  
The gamemaster decides it’s time to see how well the gangers are holding up under this onslaught. He rolls a Composure test (Willpower + Charisma) and sets a threshold of 3, since one of their fellow gangers has gone down and they’re not hardened professionals. They only have 3 dice for the test, and they get a single hit. Their composure fails, and they flee. One obstacle has been overcome!

# SECTION 11

### GAME PLAY  
After a quick conversation over their comms, the runners decide to let them go. They throw Two-Stroke in the trunk of their car and start driving. Piaffe is tracking the commlinks of the gangers and hoping they will lead them somewhere useful. He’s also waiting for them to make a call to some other members of their gang to help them know where the shipment they’re looking for may be now.

### GAME RULES  
Piaffe still has his hack into one of the ganger’s commlinks. His teammates load Two-Stroke safely in the trunk of their car, taking enough time that Piaffe’s OS goes up 5 more to 13. He rolls Electronics 5 + Intuition 5 against the ganger’s Willpower 2 (the commlink doesn’t have a Sleaze attribute). He gets 2 hits, the ganger gets none, so Piaffe’s OS only increases 1 due to the continued illegal access. He also knows where the gangers are right now, so he and the team can move out. And maybe intercept any messages that come to the commlink.
