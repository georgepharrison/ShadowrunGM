# INTRODUCTION

Some shadowrunners are stealthy, some are charming, some are ace diplomats, but pretty much all of them, at some point, need to draw down and see if they can survive an onslaught of violence that erupts in front of them. Whether it’s a trigger-happy ganger, a dauntless Lone Star officer, or an opposing shadowrunner, someone’s going to insist that the only way you’re going to get past them is with force, and you have to come through or face defeat.

**Firing Squad** is your guide to avoiding the latter, with tools and tips runners need to survive—and to deal with the aftermath of their actions. The book starts with **Weapons Rack**, which greatly expands the Shadowrun arsenal, giving players plenty of new options to bring into the field with them. **Suit Up** covers the other side of the coin, providing more armor options. **Customizing Weapons** does just what it says, providing rules and options that allow shadowrunners to put all sorts of modifications and accessories on their weapons so that they can carry exactly what they want into battle. **Honing Your Edge** recognizes that while gear is important, how you function in the field is critical. It offers tactical advice and options to help runners.

With this information, gamemasters have the tools to throw challenges at players, and players have the tools to meet them. Player characters will have to prove that they’re the ones who can survive when the firing squads of the Sixth World start raining bullets in their direction.

# HOT WARS

### BY MALIK TOMS

It was the exit interview that did her in.  
“We have to inform you that we keep the equipment.”  

She blinked hard, looked from one man to the next, a panel of five uniformed officers sitting across a squat brown folding table covered in a black cloth to project an officious tone.  
“What do you mean, ‘keep the equipment’?”  
“Regulation 459.83 of the code of post-military operations states that we have the right to retain any military-grade equipment issued to the enlisted upon the conclusion of their service.”  
She blinked. “To be clear, we are talking about cyberware here, right?”  
The men just nodded.  

After, when she felt hollow and emptied out, she had no choice but to go to Wolverine. Centurion offered much better pay, but Wolverine understood. They’d put back what was taken. The wire mattered more than she wanted to admit. It was a part of her the way violence was a part of streets she’d grown up on.  

Vanessa always found a way to stay removed. As a kid, she found her way into sports, so nobody would ask her to sell drugs or be a lookout. In the service, she leaned on her intellect, choosing an MOS that kept her away from the people who shot back. Her unit, 52 Bravo, did cleanup on the cars and drones. She didn’t have to go on the front line and put a round in a guy or watch some hopped-up ninja type slice through half a dozen of her buddies before someone on the losing team figured out where his armor wasn’t. She’d seen all those things and worse on data replay or live-fire repair jobs far removed from the front. Yet here she was, riding in a GMC Banshee dipping between the narrow spires of office buildings toward her first real frontline action.  

In the interview, Wolverine tried to explain that what they do isn’t new. The recruiter said, “Did you know Pepsi was once the sixth largest military in the world? This was long before extraterritoriality existed. Back when the world still had things called cold wars. Now it’s just an unending series of isolated hot wars. The battlefields spring up between UCAS city blocks more than they do in the desert or the Yucatan.”  

The cabin rocked as the Banshee screamed past a row of skyrakers and pushed toward the low-slung buildings of Hyde Park, St. Louis. There were six soldiers and two pilots with her, not including the captain. Three soldiers kitted out in heavy-rated security armor and MEMS tactical vests sat apart from the rest. They were ex-Devil Dogs—old-school CAS Marines. The way they held themselves gave it away. Bearded

white human had been the special operator military default for a century. Nowadays, trolls and orks were the usual ground-pounders, and the old-school guys like these were privatized. Meanwhile, she did what dwarfs always did. She went support. What she lacked in stature, she more than made up for in situational knowledge.

Another soldier, a clean-cut kid who didn’t look a day over eighteen, said, “The scan is that you’re a researcher, Bravo.” He showed his hands. “So wow us with your research.” That comment was met with chuckles. He’d said it out loud—not over the radiolink, where everything was recorded for later CYA-based analysis and finger-wagging.

Vanessa nodded. She considered ignoring the jab, but she knew this was a test. Everywhere she went there were tests. She activated her commlink and spoke clearly. “Westside Rippers are the only organized gang in this drop zone. Intelligence reports suggest they are minimally armed—pistols and less than a dozen submachine guns, likely the Shiawase model 70s, maybe one or two 71s. Resistance will be fierce, though. The attack on the client vehicle is in-character. Our clients were in a high-priced security vehicle in territory where they really don’t belong. The Rippers are looking to solidify their hold on the area and bolster recruitment, so they cannot afford to allow any actions that make them look weak. New membership capabilities are unknown, though statistically speaking they should have at least one active spellslinger.”

They were getting closer to the drop zone. The buildings were getting shorter, older. From this range, the scattered clumps of cars looked as small and fat as roaches. The few people on the streets of Hyde Park looked even smaller, huddled in their winter coats and bracing against the storm clouds she could see forming in the distance.

“Yeah, Bravo, but none of that explains how some street thugs disabled a fully armed and functional Kamekichi Sec Transport in the middle of the roughest hood in the city.” She met eyes with the soldier who was trash-talking her, and he was still grinning. She’d never been good at reading people. It could be respect, it could be mirth. Either way, it didn’t matter to the task at hand.

“The clients demanded security pull over for a photo op,” she said.

“Again with these damn desolation tourists,” the captain growled over the integrated comm channel. He pointed at individuals seated around her. “Okay, you three drop in standard cover while second team follows for extract. Newbie, you stay on deck. I’m not risking lives to get that POS transport out of the hot zone.”

“That won’t do, sir.”

“What?”

“It won’t do,” she repeated, shaking her head.

“She’s right, sir,” one of the Devil Dogs said. “The car is part of the contract. We need to get the vehicle out as well.”

HOT WARS // FIRING SQUAD

“Oh, what the shit. Okay then, Bravo. You’re on the deck. We will extract the primary, and you and my heavies Suarez, Fritz, and Grant will stay to secure and mobilize the secondary.”

She stared out the porthole. “This feels wrong.”

The one called Suarez grinned. “You’ll get past it, Newbie. Don’t think of them as gangbangers or civvies. Think of them as enemy combatants. They bleed just the same.”

“No, I mean all of this fog,” she replied. “It’s moving in way too fast.”

What had been a thin mist hardened now to a billowing cloud. It coalesced around them. The Banshee rocked and then dropped hard. Claxons sounded, and the pilot called back to them. “We’ve got magic on the field!”

The commander turned to the pilot and said, “Well, do something!”

If overly artificial cybereyes could glare, his certainly did. “Do I look like a damn spellslinger to you?”

“Jesus. Then hail base for spell support!”

The response roared back over all open channels. “Magical support is not in the contract. It needs to be cleared with the primary when we land.”

So rules of engagement gave way to cost-benefit analysis here. Private work was no different than the service at all.

“You have to drop now or never,” the captain barked. The three Devil Dogs slammed down their ballistic masks and moved quickly to the two drop lines. Everyone else followed. Even in the shaking cabin, they moved with precision, filing to the edge of the dropline and dropping soundlessly through the thick smog. Vanessa was last in the line.

Before she left the service, they’d been experimenting with Artemis Eagle harness suits the soldiers could wear and drop out of the sky like sci-fi soldiers. Here they had ropes, and all the threat that came with airdropping out of a LAV at two hundred fifty meters. Strapped tight to the drop cord, she plummeted through a sheet of grey-white smog thick enough to choke on. Suddenly, the fog parted, and the ground shot up to greet her. Vanessa was falling into a battle scene. She barely had time to focus. The streets were filled with the fires of burning wrecks. Bullets whizzed by her as she fell. The auto rig kicked in, slowing her descent as she tried to follow her training, taking quick notes of enemy positions before focusing on her landing.

The cord snapped to the right, and she spun off her axis. The quick-line rig caught, and she dangled in the air, three meters from the ground as bullets continued to surge past her. She reached into her MEMS Tactical pouch and freed a chem stick. She touched it to the rope, which dissolved instantly. She tucked herself into a ball and rolled as she struck the pavement, hoping the armor would absorb the hit. It did, mostly. She popped up, limping. Two soldiers were on her immediately. One put a hand on her back, grabbing her harness and yanking her behind the target vehicle.

Vanessa paused to catch her breath, the sounds and smells of the scene sinking in. She closed her eyes for a moment, marking the weapon sounds. She could hear the steady thump thump of Alpha Assault rifles pouring out covering fire. There was a pop and a whoosh, and she knew that someone from her side had let loose an underbarrel grenade. The report came back as a deafening boom somewhere down the block. This wasn’t how civilian-side combat was supposed to be. It felt more like the Yucatan than the streets of St Louis.

The trio of Devil Dogs had already pushed ahead and were engaging enemies from the middle of the street. Their targets were dressed in hoodies and ducked low behind old foreign cars withering under the firepower of the Wolverine soldiers. She could only see two of the other supporting soldiers. Her grinning nemesis was nowhere to be seen.

Hostile fire came back to them in waves. She recognized the crackle of newer rifles—Colt M23s, to be exact. The intel had been very wrong. This ordnance was not street-gang level. She counted out the individual reports as she’d been taught, breathed deep, and called it out over the comm channel. “Captain, we’ve got multiple targets with heavy weapons. They’ve got assault rifles, at least seventeen in all.”

She didn’t get a response, and she didn’t really expect one. Urban intel relied on local police files and reported firearm sales. When companies flooded the sprawl with grey-market weapons to boost their profits, there was no way to ever really know what the other guy had. The real arms race was on the streets. It had been like this since the UCAS broke up.

The Kamekichi transport van was dented and pocked with more bullet impacts than she could count. Still, it looked like it could drive out of there. The curb behind the transport was as bad as any war scene she’d ever seen from her drones. Members of the original security team lay dead practically on top of dead gangers. There were men and women, mostly teenagers. Blood was everywhere. Then she spotted her grinner. He’d survived the initial landing, but he’d taken several rounds in the legs and belly, and they’d punched through his medium armor even at range. She moved to him and checked his pulse. Nothing.

A man in a torn business suit with a Wolverine pin attached to his lapel was in the passenger cabin of the van. He saw Vanessa, leaned out of the transport, and asked, “Are you the rigger?”

She nodded, still looking at the bodies practically at her feet.

He grabbed her vest and shouted, “Get clear on one thing, rigger. These are not bystanders out here. Anyone not under our contract is to be treated as an enemy combatant, understand?”

She nodded, but she didn’t understand.

The clients were a couple in their forties with two kids, a boy and a girl. The kids were wild-eyed, laughing and pointing, their glee mixing with the gunfire. They’d already been told what she knew. Nothing these gangers had could get through the passenger cabin’s reactive shielding, so this was a live video game to them. The husband was doing what he could to keep them calm. The wife was losing it on the suited officer. Vanessa only caught snippets, enough to sense the anger coming off the woman and the frustration from the sergeant. That was enough to get the meaning of what they were saying. They’d paid a premium for security, and her family shouldn’t have to go through this. Vanessa heard the officer mention the magic, using corporate terms like liability and additional fees, but the client was too angry to listen. Too angry to agree to terms.


---


She mentally keyed her mic and said, “Captain, we are negative on astral support down here.”  
He replied, “Then you need to get the primary out by ground. We are not going to risk the LAV against magic. Repeat: We cannot extract.”  

Suddenly, the sound of a big-bore rifle punched through the air, and one of the two men who’d dragged her to safety crumpled. She recognized the sound immediately as a Springfield M-1400. Screams of “Sniper!” poured in across the comms as she counted down the seconds for the reload.  

The Devil Dogs were still pushing the attack south. They gunned down three more people before falling back to cover in a narrow alley between a stuffer shack and an apartment building. The rifle cracked again in their retreat, and one of them flew backward. His buddies grabbed him and pulled him—what was left—to safety. Suarez yelled, “We can’t stay here!”  

She kicked into gear then and decided she needed to get the vehicle working, which meant jacking into the rigger control interface. Vanessa pulled open the driver’s side door. A security officer in his BDUs was still jacked in and slumped over in the seat. She checked for a pulse, found none, and pulled him out of the seat. She needed to get a better read on the situation.  

She fed the cord into her jack and started running diagnostics on the repair. Self-inflating tires were already at work, bracing against the damage of heavy-caliber rounds. The engine was functional, but front and rear cameras had shut down. This transport model was top of the line and came stocked with a trio of microskimmer drones. She considered radioing in for permission to apply the resources but thought better of it. They needed eyes in the sky. They needed to find the sniper and whatever else was waiting for them in these streets. Better to ask for forgiveness later under these conditions. She ejected one from the launcher to get a better look at the field.  

The combat zone could’ve been her own block growing up. Brennan Street was a long row of brown and grey tenement apartments interspersed by storefronts. Above, the strange cloud cover still blotted out the sky. People sporting bright purple hoodies ducked behind the cars that lined the street, some of which were now burning. Others stood in doorways firing off shots before ducking inside and away from the return fire. There was a laundromat two hundred meters south. Through the drone’s eyes, she could see people clustered inside. They looked terrified. She supposed they ought to be. There was a full-scale war taking place right outside their door. She wondered how many of them had friends in the conflict. Or children. They made the choice to be on the ground and in the fight, and now they were paying for it. Vanessa shook the thought away and repositioned the drone to continue scanning for threats.  

She found the sniper crouched on a roof a half-block north of the laundromat. Caught the muzzle flash as he pumped out another murderous round. The ork was dressed in a black longcoat and looked too old to be a ganger. She remembered what the officer had said, though, and quickly called in his position.  

In response, an underbarrel grenade arced toward the target, detonating on the rooftop. Directed fire followed, and when the smoke cleared, the shooter was down. Hot wars indeed, she thought, and continued scanning and feeding target locations to her team. Her diagnostic check flashed a report and she keyed a line to the team, “We need three more minutes for repairs. Fall back to my position.”  

The map showed that this stretch of Bremen avenue fed into Interstate 70. If they could get underway, it was a clear path to safety. There was a school between there and here, and she thought—she hoped—they wouldn’t pursue that far. They might, though. It struck her that the people here were trying to protect their way of life. What was she protecting? Who was she fighting for? A too-rich family who wanted to treat their kids to a glimpse of how the other half lives? For that glimpse, dozens of people had already died. When she was in the service, she weighed deaths against the freedom it provided to her fractured nation—her collection of states and cities. Here, the scales balanced differently.  

The security team moved back toward the vehicle, one soldier laying down cover fire as the rest moved to a shielded position and laid down fire so he could retreat. They moved like this until every person who could walk was in the transport. She noted that they hadn’t stopped to retrieve the dead. A second team would be deployed for that task, complete with auditors and insurance adjusters to determine cause of death and resultant compensation.  

Her transport’s rear-mounted cameras only needed a final tweak to come back online. In milliseconds, her senses were flooded with the panoramic display of the warscape behind her. Targeting reticules locked on to at least a dozen more hostiles, outlining them in red. Some were just children and old people leaning out of windows in the buildings above, others, barely fighting age, rushed into the streets to scavenge the bodies of the fresh dead. She saw a man dressed in a Hungry Harry’s uniform pull a gun off a body to fire ineffective shots at the fleeing transport.  

That was when Vanessa decided who she was fighting for. She certainly wasn’t fighting for the client. She was doing it for a paycheck and a hot bowl of ramen at the end of the night. She was doing it for the promise of something better; for the wire and what that meant to her. That is what she still was, after all: a soldier. A rigger. This battlefield had now proved itself more dangerous than the dozen others she’d spilled blood on over her career. There weren’t good guys and bad guys here, just the ones with the biggest guns. Today, it’d been her people. As she drove back toward the nearest Wolverine FoB, she wondered how she could make sure she’d have the biggest guns next time.

> Few weeks back, Glitch came to me asking for assistance in updating JackPoint’s files regarding current trends in modern combat and weaponry. And obviously I agreed, otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this. And to get this out of the way before anyone asks … I’ve been a merc or a runner since I was sixteen, I’m a martial artist of multiple disciplines, and I’m a master armorer. Each of the weapons listed here is indicative of current trends or represents classic weapon designs. Most of the weapon platforms listed here are ones I’ve either used in the field or tested on the range. Those I haven’t, I’ve gotten some guest speakers to chime in on.

### HAND TALONS

Designed to be both a weapon-retention tool and a last-ditch defensive weapon, “hand talons” is a generic term that describes a wide variety of small curved or straight blades between 2.5 and 8 centimeters. Talons come in multiple shapes/styles and are worn on the fingers—attached to a glove, gauntlet, or ring that can be used or worn in conjunction with a standard firearm with no loss of weapon performance. Although it’s recommended that talons are worn on the off hand so to not interfere with normal firearm use and to prevent accidents.

### HORIZON-FLYNN PILUM

Building on the surprising success of the Horizon-Flynn Rapier, Horizon once again teamed up with Flynn Armaments to create another modern variation on a classic movie weapon. Horizon’s latest trideo, *Barbarax and the Space Gladiators*, features a gorgeous woman in barely any armor fighting off legions of warriors that conspicuously look like Ares Macrotechnology goons. She uses a collapsible spear in the climax scene, where she throws the Pilum and impales two goons against a wall.

Collapsing or extending the spear takes a Minor Action.  
**Wireless bonus:** Collapsing or extending the spear refunds a Minor Action.

### KAMI

Basically a small handheld scythe, the kami were originally used in the rice-fields of Asia as a farming tool. But like a lot of other farming tools of the day, they were pressed into service as weapons and eventually adopted by martial artists. Although its popularity as a weapon waned for several decades, relegated mostly to exhibitions, the kami has made a comeback in recent years with the introduction of a folding model made of modern materials. Extremely effective in piercing attacks, the razor-sharp blade can also be used to block, disarm, and trap an opponent’s weapon.

> They also make a rather handy improvised climbing tool when you don’t have time to bust out the full climbing gear. But don’t think these are all you need, either.

# KUKRI

Legend states that if a kukri is drawn, it must draw blood. Originally made famous by the legendary Gurkhas of India and Nepal, the kukri is a curved combat blade known for its extraordinary cutting ability while slashing, although it makes a poor piercing or thrusting weapon. The kukri also makes a good cutting and hacking tool in the field when necessary. Combine that legend with cutting-edge nano-forging technology, and the kukri is one of the deadliest combat knives currently in use.

* There are certain warrior sects in Nepal descended from the Gurkhas that get a little testy when outsiders are seen brandishing a kukri. Seems they see it as a bit of an insult for one who has not proven themselves worthy to wield one.  
  - Red Anya
* You can be gifted one after performing a great service to one of those sects. And don’t think that performing such a service is easy, or that you can just show up and perform one. They consider that a bit insulting.

# NODACHI

Also known as the *odachi* (large/great sword), the *nodachi* (or field sword) was originally used by the samurai in the feudal era of Japan mostly as an infantry and anti-cavalry weapon. It was too long to be carried on the hip or drawn quickly from a back scabbard and thus was often carried in-hand while still scabbarded. With the rise in popularity of weapons such as the katana, the nodachi also underwent a resurgence in popularity, especially among street samurai and other urban fighter-types. The original nodachi was notoriously difficult and expensive to make with traditional Japanese methods, but modern forging methods make the process significantly easier and cheaper; nodachis can be found at most weapon outlets with little effort. And they are considered legal in most countries. While not quite as popular as the katana, the nodachi is still a formidable weapon. The long blade makes it an ideal melee weapon for engaging multiple opponents at longer ranges than traditional blades. Modern go-gangs have also been known to employ a nodachi in slashing attacks from vehicles.

> The length can be a double-edged sword (pun intended). While its reach is certainly an advantage, the nodachi isn’t a speedy weapon, relying more on brute strength like one would a claymore or broadsword for damage. But make no mistake; this is a weapon of war.

# TRENCH KNIFE

Trench knives are what you get when you merge a pair of knucks and a combat knife. The concept first became popular during the deadly trench fighting of World War I, when combat became extremely up-close and personal. Designed to punch, stab, or slash as needed, trench knives come in a variety of styles (open-knuckle, ring, with/without studs or spikes, etc.), but the basic design has a finger/knuckle guard attached to a blade that is typically between fourteen and eighteen centimeters. An inelegant weapon, trench knives are designed to be straightforward and all business.

> Trench knives are sometimes considered a low-brow weapon among the martial arts and fighting communities—the common view is that they’re simple and crude. I like anything that works.

### COUGAR WEAPONS “LONG TOOTH” COLLAPSIBLE STAFF/SPEAR

Spears, staffs, and polearms in general have long been effective melee weapons in the right circumstances. They’re fairly versatile, have good reach, and can be used in a variety of offensive and defensive strategies that would take too much time to cover in detail. While not effective in modern combat scenarios where firearms and launch weapons still rule, spears and staffs are still considered a major threat in a melee combat arena where they can give one hell of an old-fashioned beatdown. But like any weapon, they have drawbacks. They’re fragging large, hard to hide, and not as effective in tight terrain or close quarters. Various attempts were made to make polearms collapsible, the first being the use of an old-style friction lock system commonly used by extendable batons. But these were often weak, and the lock often broke after a few good strikes. Cougar Weapons Company found a way around this in the mid 2070s when they introduced their first collapsible spear made from a memory-steel alloy. This alloy could collapse into a shape the size of a standard knife and then expand again with no loss in tensile strength. In 2079, Cougar upped the ante by introducing the Long Tooth, a newer and advanced collapsible staff/spear system made of the same memory steel. When collapsed, the Long Tooth is slightly longer than a combat knife blade handle. When activated, the Long Tooth can extend to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 meters. The Long Tooth comes with an optional twelve-centimeter detachable blade that can be utilized with both collapsed and extended modes, making it a true spear.

> No surprise that these are popular with adepts, martial artists, and street toughs of all kinds. I won mine two months ago in a Soho back alley after some wannabe kung-fool monk tried to teach me the “proper” way to fight. He forgot the first rule of fighting: There are no rules, except win. Hope he found a good replacement for his teeth.  
> Chainmaker

> Nice. But I would also caution anyone trying to use the extending feature as a strike option. The mechanisms, for lack of a better term (I don’t know exactly how it works) apparently can’t take that kind of abuse more than once, maybe twice. Wait the half second it takes for the weapon to completely extend to the desired length before use. Otherwise, it may not work the next time, which could be quite detrimental. Trust me—I learned the hard way.

While other companies might look at this two-meter-long metallic stick and think it’s just a stick, Dassault has taken an old classic and implemented a suite of fancy features that make this an invaluable tool for climbing, hiking, and survival. It can serve as a walking stick, but it’s also made of lightweight and strong titanium, so that it can break trees, rocks, and other hard objects that get in the way (think faces and bones). Additionally, it holds a suite of tools within the stick, allowing it to be used as a spear (this can help with moving along icy surfaces), a short knife, a fish scaler, a flint, a whistle, a glass breaker, and even a multi-tool. And it also comes with a compass, flashlight, and a rod that can be used to purify water when submerged for a couple minutes. The water purification rod can be reused but requires a full twelve hours between uses to keep it fresh.

mer is the right tool for the job. Available in both short- and long-handled versions, the tactical hammer typically comes with a spiked striking face to embed into the target in order to prevent target skip and ensure kinetic energy transfer, while a weighted head helps enhance the overall profile. Some models also come with either a reinforced blade or heavy spike attached for those times when switching to another weapon isn’t feasible.

### Ash Arms Combat Chainsaw

Despite how impractical a weapon it may actually be in combat, someone will inevitably try and employ it at some point because of the “rule of cool.” And Ash Arms is cashing in on this saying with their combat chainsaw. What differentiates the combat chainsaw from the standard cutting tool are two main things. First, several key components are reinforced to handle more rigorous use and not break down because of overstress and rough handling. Second, combat chainsaws are melee hardened for another layer of protection, which also allows them to be used to bash an opponent if attacking with the saw component isn’t feasible. While the combat chainsaw may be somewhat impractical in most combat situations save a back-alley brawl, they have a certain intimidation factor that can be used to provide multiple advantages. Ash offers its combat chainsaw in two types: a standard and monofilament version, the latter supposedly providing more damage potential. But most often it’s more hazardous to the user than the target.

> Back-alley brawls are what this was made for! Dwarf street sam mate of mine likes to use this thing whenever possible, yells out “I’ll bring ya down to **my size!**” before charging. Normally I’d say he’s a suicidal wanker, but frag me if it doesn’t work more often than not.

# MANRIKI CHAIN

Also known as a *kusari-fundo* or *manrikigusari* (ten thousand power chain), the manriki chain is a handheld weapon dating back to feudal Japan, where it was used as a “non-bloodletting weapon.” While the specs may vary, a manriki chain is made up of the *kusari* (chain) and the *fundo*, a weight attached to the ends of the chain. The manriki’s total length varies between 30 and 120 centimeters (although longer ones are common), and the fundo typically weighs between 60 and 120 grams. In combat, the manriki can be used to strike an opponent with the fundo ends, or entrap an opponent’s limbs with the kusari. Additionally, the manriki is also a popular weapon to disarm opponents. However, the manriki chain is not an easy weapon to deploy without extensive training and practice.

[The image shows a manriki chain with a close-up of the chain links.]

* You see these in the trids and sims—some martial artist spinning them, smacking some sod in the face or ripping a weapon out of their hands. Like most of that stuff, it’s complete bulldrek, but these are useful to whip a motherfragger with.

## Zoé Heritage Line

In the late 2060s, Zoé worked with several manufacturers to produce a series of historically accurate clothing lines, made to order. The line was tremendously successful, and Zoé received numerous requests for accessories. After keeping the line going for a decade, Zoé decided to shutter the line to help build more demand. Now Zoés back, and they are bringing people what they’ve always wanted: weapons to accompany the clothes.

Zoé has carefully curated a selection of classical weapon designs that they believe will be most in demand around the world and across a wide range of cultures. Each of the weapons are custom-made to the design needs of the buyer and come with the personalized grip and metahuman adjustment modifications built in (the stats reflect this modification). Moreover, these weapons can add two additional modifications of the user’s choice at no additional cost.

## Ranged Weapons

### Collapsible Crossbow

The modern crossbow is made of high-tech materials that allow it to be easily collapsed into itself, condensing itself down to a much smaller size. This makes these weapons ideal when concealability is a concern, especially as the materials are not metallic and contain no chemical agents that can be detected with chemical detection sensors.

Light models are single-handed, while standard and heavy designs require two hands to operate. To collapse or expand a collapsible crossbow requires a Major Action. These crossbows can only support internal modifications when collapsed. When expanded, these crossbows can accept any modifications that can be top-mounted on a firearm.

**Wireless bonus:** Expanding or collapsing the crossbow can be done remotely, and only requires a Minor Action.

### Hold-outs

#### Colt Secret Agent

The Colt Agent Special has long been one of their standbys, so the company decided to enter the hold-out market to see if their name would give a punch to a frequently punchless market. The Secret Agent doesn’t pack a serious punch—it’s still a hold-out, after all—but its flatness makes it one of the most concealable guns on the market. On top of that, its non-metal construction keeps it from being picked up by scanners that catch other guns. All that, and you don’t sacrifice a ton of accuracy.

> Positioning is important with this one. If you put it on your hip, it’s going to stand out, no matter how flat it is. The small of your back may work, depending on what you’re wearing. I like putting it near my appendix, since it’s easier to reach there. Just make sure you have a holster that’s as slim as the gun.

# LIGHT PISTOLS

## COLT AGENT SPECIAL

Based on a frame that’s over a century old, the Colt Agent Special (often mistakenly called the Special Agent) is a firearm that isn’t quite sure what it wants to be. It fires heavy pistol rounds, but because of its small barrel size has the range profile of a light pistol. Yet, it’s almost small enough to be a hold-out pistol, which means it is easily concealed. Still, no matter what the weapon is, the Agent Special makes an excellent choice as a backup or secondary weapon because of its accuracy and raw hitting power in such a small platform. The Agent Special’s only drawbacks are the limited ammo capacity and the inability to accept any internal modifications such as a smartgun system or mount any accessory rails. The only modification the Agent Special can accept is a proprietary laser sight (additional 50 nuyen) made by Colt that can be mounted in the top of the grip just under the slide rail.

> * It’s also extremely easy to use and, as already stated, easy to conceal. Myself and more than a few of my magical colleagues who aren’t necessarily into firearms like to carry the Agent Special as a last line of defense or for those times when our magics aren’t exactly practical.

# HK P50 TACTICAL

HK wants a bigger piece of the sidearm market, and this is the gun that might get it for them. An integral smartgun system is supplemented by an offline laser sight system that adjusts for range to target. Standard mounting rails built and fitted for specialized holsters make the whole package a must-have for any collector, while its functionality makes it useful for the street samurai with a discerning palate.

> * Cute description, but they completely skip over the reason HK will make a killing off this and its bulkier counterpart, the P60. They field-strip to base parts in seconds. This makes them the ultimate throwaway.

# HEAVY PISTOLS

## CAVALIER ARMS MARSHAL

Building on their reputation as the preeminent revolver manufacturer (according to their PR), Cavalier Arms recently introduced the Marshal, their first “variable loadout” heavy revolver in direct competition with the Ares Predator VI, which features a similar ammunition selection system. Comprising a powered cylinder, an under-barrel boxy ammunition reservoir/collection system for spent brass, and ammunition transfer system, the Marshal can reload without opening the cylinder.

**FIREARMS // WEAPONS RACK**

by accessing the weapon’s internal smartgun system. However, the weapon can only hold twelve rounds total; six in the cylinder and six in the reservoir along the weapon’s left side. And while the transfer system has proven to be more reliable than the Predator VI’s, the weight of the extra ammunition along one side of the weapon sometimes causes balance and accuracy issues at longer ranges.  
> A neat thing about the Marshal is that the spent brass reservoir can store up to nine spent casings before it needs to be purged. Makes policing them a bit easier.  
> Mika  
> All well and good, but the damn thing is so damn **heavy** compared to other revolvers and heavy pistols in general, which also adds to the inaccuracy at longer ranges. And for such a low ammo capacity and average damage, I’ll keep my new Predator, thanks.

## NEMESIS ARMS PRAETORIAN II

Even though Nemesis’ marketing calls the Praetorian II a “spectacular upgrade to a timeless classic,” this heavy pistol is nothing more than a functional yet unspectacular gun with a slightly above-average knife attached in an attempt to create a weapon that is greater than the sum of its parts, but in truth is pretty much just a gimmick. Even though it’s a gimmick weapon, it’s a popular one, especially among street-warrior types. As a sidearm, the Praetorian II features an adequate damage profile and smartgun system, but it lacks the ammunition capacity when compared with other weapons in its class. As a melee weapon, the attached blade is serviceable but best utilized as a slashing weapon, which can sometimes be tricky in extreme close melee combat, where thrusting is a better tactic.

> Adding a mono-edge to the blade greatly enhances performance but increases the chance of accidents when drawing or holstering.  
> Am-Mut  
> Word of advice: thoroughly clean this thing ASAP after each blade use, because blood and viscera can (and will) gum up the slide action and trigger assembly, causing misfires.

# MACHINE PISTOLS

## COLT ARMS M-24

Building on the success of their M-23 rifle and M-23A2 carbine, Colt introduced their M-24 “machine pistol,” which is also based on the M-22/AR platform. Slightly larger than a standard machine pistol but smaller than an SMG, the M-24 looks like a stripped-down M-23A2 with the buttstock removed and a shorter barrel. Marketed as a personal defense weapon, the M-24 is meant to be deployed in extremely tight quarters, such as a vehicle. But the higher caliber, short barrel, and lack of any standard recoil compensation make this weapon somewhat difficult to control in burst or full-auto fire. To compensate for this, Colt also offers an after-market “stabilizing arm-brace” for an additional 100 nuyen.

> Colt tried to market the M-24 to personal security providers, but it never caught on. Damage is fine, but it bucks like a SOB and control is not something I want to skimp on; collateral damage is hard on the rep.  
> — 0rkCE0

> A lot of M-24s have been dumped on the black market, and several of the bigger syndicates have been handing them out to affiliate gangs as “gifts.”

## ULTIMAX 71

A little old-fashioned but still effective, the Ultimax 71 is a gun for people who don’t think it requires electronics to make lead fly. There’s a beautiful simplicity in a handgun designed to fling enough bullets to keep an entire squad nervous about getting closer to you. It’s got a laser sight to help with targeting, and the biggest change from the old 70 to the new 71 is the smaller design. It’s still a machine pistol, so it’s not going to be easy to just tuck under your shirt and hope no one notices, but you might have an easier time putting it under a jacket or in a handbag than you would have with the 70.

# SUBMACHINE GUNS

## CAVALIER ARMS-PARASHIELD EMERGENCY RESPONDER

Cavalier Arms made a decent impression with the law enforcement/security community in North America when they released their Lancer shotgun/grenade launcher combo back in ’74. So when Parashield, Narcoject’s prime competition in the less-than-lethal weapon market came to them with a proposal to develop a new weapons platform that can fire with both lethal and non-lethal force, Cavalier was more than willing to play ball.

After years of R&D and testing, the Emergency Responder was born in 2078, answering a question no one was asking. A combination SMG and dart gun, the Responder was intended to give officers and/or first responders a primary non-lethal option when dealing with subjects who may not deserve immediate termination. The Responder’s SMG component (supplied by Cavalier) is a compact bullpup design that is reliable and fairly accurate. The dart gun component (supplied by Parashield) is fixed underneath the SMG’s barrel, just forward of the trigger assembly, and features a ten-dart mini-clip and small gas reservoir good for ten uses. An electronic firing system and integrated smartgun system allow the shooter to switch between the two weapons with only a thought or voice command. An optional manual switch is also available as an aftermarket accessory.

While distributed to several law enforcement and security contractors throughout North America, the Responder never truly caught on. It may have had something to do with several incidents where officers, thinking they had the dart gun engaged, accidentally employed the SMG, with disastrous results. Most of these departments and security companies blamed Cavalier and Parashield for defective equipment contributing to the incidents. In most of these cases, Cavalier and Parashield were cleared of any wrongdoing, but the Emergency Responder gained a negative reputation that persists to this day.

> This meant that scores of Emergency Responders were dumped on the secondary and black markets, where they have actually been decent sellers. Too bad Cavalier ceased production two months ago. If you want them, get them while you can, because the only corps producing new models are going to be the knock-off outfits.

* So what was to blame for these accidents?  
  * Treadle

* In my opinion, a combination of poor concept, poor design, but in most cases poor training. There’s a reason you don’t combine lethal and less-than-lethal options (there is no such thing as “non-lethal”) in one package, the chance for error is too great; especially when the adrenaline is pumping during a chaotic and dynamic situation.

* Hard Exit

* I’ve used this thing a few times. Anyone who knows how to handle a firearm properly should have no issues.

* 0rkCE0

* I agree with Hard Exit. When the drek is going down you may not even have the time to switch modes. And I for one do not want to try to take on a big bad with darts, no matter what they’re loaded with. Hell, I’d prefer a bigger gun in general, but that’s me.

* Cayman

* I did a little digging and found some internal memos that Cavalier did in fact try to tell Parashield that the electronic firing system and smartgun systems weren’t completely synching up. But Parashield, who was bankrolling most of the project, wanted the product out sooner rather than later.

* Netcat

* Parashield was feeling the heat from a renewed Narcoject product line and marketing blitz. They wanted a game changer to regain the lead. But instead, the resulting blowback from the Emergency Responder almost sunk the company. As soon as their contract obligations were met with Parashield, Cavalier washed their hands of the whole thing.

* Mr. Bonds

* The Emergency Responder isn’t all bad. I know a combat medic out of Detroit who uses one to help treat people in the field with darts loaded with meds, anti-toxins, and that sort of thing. It’s a rather unconventional methodology, but when you’re under fire and someone is running through it to save your sorry hoop, it’s hard to complain!

## Shiawase Arms Tactical Model 71A

Released to the general market in 2079, the Tactical Model 71A is an upgrade of Shiawase’s popular Model 71. With a well-earned reputation as a rugged SMG, the original Model 71 was developed as part of a Shiawase product initiative known as “Mobile Warrior” and packs as many features into the weapon’s frame as possible. Made of the same lightweight materials, the 71A is designed to be extremely user-friendly (read: usable by less-skilled shooters) and comes with the following standard features: an electronic firing system, Safe Targeting system, internal smartgun system, collapsible stock, and integrated foregrip. While these systems are useful, in the Model 71 they frequently overtaxed the weapon’s power supply, sometimes to the point of complete failure. To remedy this, the 71A comes with a larger and reportedly more efficient power system. To make room for this, designers went with a lower-caliber round. Whether these changes have been effective is unknown, as the weapon hasn’t been in service long enough to be properly evaluated.

* So far, the new power systems seem to be adequate for the job. But several merc and security units are instructing their people to disable some of the targeting systems until they are needed. Kind of defeats the purpose of the upgraded power systems, but it should help mitigate power issues and extend battery life.

* Picador

* Too bad the 71A isn’t quite as durable as its predecessor. I have fond memories of using an older 71 to bash faces in.

* Cayman

* It may not pack the heaviest punch, but the Model 71A is extremely accurate, which allows for better shot placement, which is what any shooter **should** be striving for anyway. I’ve used it many times as my secondary weapon with no complaints.

* But I change the batteries regularly, just in case.

### Colt MS-27

In recent years, Colt has been criticized of milking the AR-style platform for all it’s worth instead of coming up with more innovative designs. In reply, Colt said “if it ain’t broke, why fix it?” With the rise of the “assault shotgun” concept, Colt got in on the act late last year by releasing an assault

shotgun version of their classic M-23. Called the MS-27, the entire weapon frame was re-tooled to accommodate standard twelve-gauge shotgun shells and then reinforced to handle the additional recoil and stress. The result was a solid overall weapon capable of up to full-auto fire. Those familiar with the M-23/23A2 line can easily transition to the MS-27 with little or no training. In fact, both the M-23 and the MS-27 are approximately the same size and share several of the same parts, which makes field repair and overall logistics simpler. And while the MS-27 doesn’t come with any accessories or modifications in order to keep the overall price down, it comes with four accessory rails standard on the top, sides, and under barrel, making it easy to modify and accessorize.

> A simple but effective design, the MS-27 is relatively easy to shoot, and the recoil isn’t too outrageous considering you’re still firing a full-auto shotgun. And better yet, it’s a lot easier to get a hold of on the open market.  
> Danger Sensei

> Maybe I’m spoiled (because I have the money and connections), but I’ll stick with other models, like the AA-16 which has better recoil despite being larger. Sometimes, you have to pay more to get what works better for you.  
> /dev/grrl

> Some early field reports indicate that the MS-27 is susceptible to dirt and grime if not regularly maintained, especially after repeated, sustained full-auto fire. It’s also been known to improperly feed if the shooter doesn’t secure the weapon properly against their shoulder during use.

## DEFIANCE T-285

Sometimes you just need a plain, simple, in-your-face, no-frills, boom-stick; especially if that boom-stick has three barrels. What started out as a joke within the Defiance Corporation quickly became a serious issue for the company. Starting out as a personal project by one of Defiance’s gunsmiths and intended as a gag gift for the company’s CEO, word of “a secret new project” reached the ears of a corporate spy within Defiance, who quickly attempted to acquire the non-existent specs, only to find crude sketches (on a bar napkin) of a tri-barrel, pistol-gripped, break-away shotgun. Through a series of misadventures and blunders, these images ended up on Matrix and quickly went viral. Seizing the opportunity, Defiance quickly drew up proper specs for copyright purposes and then began limited production, which ran out in short order and forced a second, third, and forth production run. Considered a novelty, albeit a powerful one, the T-285 is nothing more than three sawed-off T-280 shotgun barrels welded together in a pyramid formation. Manual switches behind the barrel-break control the number of shots fired (one, two, or all three), and the choke if applicable. There is no smartlink, no accessories, and no frills of any kind. What one gets from the T-285 is exactly what they should expect: power at the risk of breaking one’s wrist.

## FRANCHI SPAS-25

The SPAS line of shotguns has been a staple among paramilitary and security forces for the better part of a half-century and isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. The current SPAS-25 is a relatively simple and straightforward design that harkens back to the earlier SPAS-22 yet still retains many of the innovative features that made the SPAS-24 popular. Highly adaptable and reliable, the normally semi-automatic SPAS-25 can also operate as a pump-action to quickly clear jams or facilitate emergency tactical reloads. The SPAS-25 also comes standard with a smartgun system and folding stock for ease of storage. In addition, the

SPAS-25 also features serrated breaching teeth on the barrel. These teeth assist with barrel seating against a door for breaching actions, helping hold the barrel in place during discharge.

## RANGER ARMS AA-16 "WARHAMMER"

Three years ago, Ranger Arms bought the rights to the venerable AA-16 assault shotgun. The consensus at the time was they had just obtained a gold mine of sales. That turned out to be the case. Considered to be the pinnacle of assault shotguns, the AA-16, better known as “The Warhammer,” is a heavy-hitting, short-to-medium-range, full-auto-capable weapons platform known for being able to take down even the toughest of adversaries while still having one of the lowest recoil profiles of *any* weapon currently in service. The Warhammer also comes with an internal smartgun system and foregrip (which does not interfere with under-barrel accessories) as standard. Maintenance is also incredibly easy, as the firing mechanisms and bolt actions are constructed from a chrome/stainless-steel alloy that resists all but the most extreme grime and dirt buildup. The only real problem the Warhammer suffers from, aside from its extremely hefty price tag, is that it’s almost too good and popular a design. While Ranger Arms is making money hand over fist producing the Warhammer, their production lines are severely backlogged. This has made the weapon a hot commodity on the streets and black markets. Unless you have a good contact with an inside track, happen to find one in-store (good luck with that), or want to wait for delivery from Ranger Arms, expect at least a fifty to seventy percent markup when you do find one.

# RIFLES

## IZOM ARTEMIS

The Artemis is one of those weapon systems that can be effective in the right hands, but a liability in others. Designed almost exclusively for close-quarters battle, it features shortened barrels for both the carbine and grenade launcher and no buttstock. This has (rightfully) earned the Artemis a reputation of being extremely inaccurate (and dangerous in inexperienced hands), yet the weapon remains popular in certain circles because of the grenade launcher. Instead of a smartgun system, the Artemis comes with a laser sight as standard.

# OPTIONAL WEAPON CLASS: CARBINES

The world of firearms is vast and variable, with categories that do not always have strict boundaries. One example is the carbine, which exists somewhere between a pistol and a rifle—it tends to be shorter than rifles, and sometimes uses the same ammunition as pistols. For the purposes of this book, carbines are treated the same as rifles, but some groups may wish to make them into their own category, which means they use separate ammunition and have a separate specialization. Carbines included in this book are:

* Onotari Arms Kali II  

## ONOTARI ARMS JP-K51

The history and evolution of the JP-K series of battle rifles is a long and convoluted one. Originally conceived to fight the next round of Euro Wars that never happened, the first runs of the original JP-K49 sat collecting dust in European warehouses for decades before the production lines were re-started with a new model, an upgraded version known as the JP-K50. The 49 and 50 gained popularity during the Dragon Civil War because they proved to be somewhat effective against (some) dracoforms (in mass fire situations) and were used exclusively by forces loyal to Lofwyr. Those who survived the battles were allowed to keep these powerful weapons as partial payment for services rendered. After the Civil War, the JP-K lines slowed to almost a crawl, and those produced were used almost (key word there) exclusively by Saeder-Krupp corporate military or affiliated forces. In 2077, Onotari announced they were producing a new model, the JP-K51, for mass-market release. This new model varied little from the previous two, except that it now included a smartgun system as standard. The JP-K doesn’t quite fit securely in any traditional weapon category, but with its range and damage profile, combined with its burst-fire capability, it’s usually classified as an enhanced battle rifle. Designed with a high degree of engineering and precision machining, and made from the highest quality materials, the JP-K51 is expensive but is also extremely good at what it does: providing long-range precision fire on a platoon or even fire-team level. The only complaints about the weapon so far are that it’s extremely bulky and nose-heavy, especially when accessories (such as a bipod) are attached.

> The unbalanced nature of the JP-K can be problematic when you don’t have something to brace it on or against, because that front end gets heavy really fragging quick, which can mess with your shot placement. Doesn’t even come with an adjustable stock, which is stupid. I had one in my personal arsenal for about a year and it shot just fine, but transport was a pain. And every time I went indoors, I had to sling it and pull my secondary weapon. Not an ideal situation. So I sold it and got a Crockett, which is a better option, in my opinion.

> Opinions vary. Sharpshooter on my personal team uses the 51 like a sniper rifle and has no issues with the standard stock.

> If it’s who I’m thinking of, he’s a dwarf with short arms anyway, so the point is moot.  
> — Balladeer

> A lot of the remaining JP-K50s and the first runs of the 51s are set to be delivered to the 22ⁿᵈ Spartan Legion mercenary unit by month’s end. Seems they solved the balance problem by bracing their JP-Ks on their ballistic shields.

## ONOTARI ARMS KALI II

Based on the same “AR”-style weapon that eventually evolved into modern weapons such as Colt’s M-22A2, M-23, 23A2, and so on, the Kali II is Onotari Arms’ version of that venerable platform. Overall, the Kali II is a rugged, no-frills, hard-hitting carbine based on the original Kali assault rifle. And while it’s based on the AR, functionally it has more in common with the also-classic AK line of weapons in terms of durability and damage profile. Like an AK, a Kali II requires minimal maintenance to remain combat-ready and can be easily serviced in the field. The Kali II’s hardened design also allows it to be used as an impromptu melee weapon in emergency situations with minimal loss of function. Designed specifically to dominate in short- to mid-range combat, the Kali II is extremely accurate up to standard long ranges before weapon performance drops off. Additionally, the Kali II is melee hardened and features four standard powered weapon rails—one long rail along the top, two on the barrel’s sides, and one under-barrel—that make it extremely customizable.

> Just my two yen, but the Kali is what the M-23 and A2 wanted to be.  
> — Riot

> Fun fact: Colt tried three times to sue Onotari for copyright infringement because they felt they had proprietary rights to the AR-style platform. Turns out, the Corporate Court disagreed citing legal precedents going back to the twentieth century.

Colt eventually dropped the suits, but they like to file a new one whenever Onotari puts out a similar product.  
> Mr. Bonds  
> Colt needs to fire their legal staff, because suing Onotari over this is pure idiocy. It’s owned by S-K, and Lowfyr could and will bury Colt on a whim if they keep up this kind of drek. Pick better battles.

## ONOTARI ARMS RHINO HUNTER ALPHA AND BETA

The Original Rhino Hunter entered the sporting rifle market about ten years ago. Designed specifically for “larger metahumans” (you know who they mean), the Rhino Hunter is very straightforward in its design: Build a rifle around one of the most powerful hunting rounds in the world and then make it large enough to comfortably fit in the hands of the larger metahumans who can typically handle its massive recoil. And then market it! But despite the awkward marketing, the Rhino Hunter became a popular weapon within the troll and ork communities. Then two years ago, demand for a more “traditional” sized Rhino Hunter became great enough that Onotari started making two versions: the traditional Alpha, and the smaller Beta. Although all Onotari did was re-size the Alpha’s grips and controls, then slap a new name on it. The Rhino Hunter is made of heavily reinforced materials to resist damage from recoil (even though it does next to nothing to mitigate it). The aforementioned ammo is held in an internal magazine that contains seven shots. While this ammo capacity is normally insufficient for most modern battlefields, the purpose of the Rhino Hunter is not technically traditional combat, but to select a target and put it down. Both the Alpha and Beta lack any standard upgrades, but it’s expected the owner will customize their rifle to meet their specific needs and preferences.

> The Rhino Hunter hits almost as hard as an assault cannon and is one of those weapons that if you hit, the target is likely dead.  
> Beaker  
> And this thing is widely available and completely legal.  
> Unbelievable …  
> Pistons  
> Not to rag on you smallsies here, but I took my Rhino Hunter to the range to recalibrate it a few months back and saw a group of smooth … err, humans testing their new Beta out. The Rhino is about the same length as a standard anti-materiel rifle. In a troll’s hands, it’s like carrying an assault rifle. For these slags, they needed a bipod and several bracers to take a shot. And yeah, I laughed my hoop off when the first shooter got smacked in the face when he didn’t seat it properly against his shoulder.

## ONOTARI ARMS WAR HOUND

Conceived to be an effective weapon system at almost all ranges *and* suitable for multiple combat environments/situations, the War Hound is a bullpup-style assault rifle based on Onotari’s successful Room Sweeper line (not to be confused with Remington’s Roomsweeper pistol/shotgun). Using the Room Sweeper as a base, designers trimmed a lot of fat to make the War Hound lighter and more compact. And with the same barrel-length as standard assault rifles, the War Hound remains effective at longer ranges despite a shorter overall length. Additionally, the War Hound stands out because it’s on average eighty to seventy-five percent smaller *and* lighter than other weapons in its class. To make it even more effective in close-quarters, an under-barrel six-round shotgun was added for additional punch and for use as a breaching weapon. The Hound also features as standard an electronic firing system, two side rails, and an internal smartgun system that is housed and almost completely contained on the top of the weapon, which allows for ease of repair/replacement in the field. The War Hound isn’t an optimized weapon, but it’s damn close.

> Full disclosure: I used the Onotari Room Sweeper as my personal assault rifle for almost ten years until I lost it three years ago. And during that time, it never failed me, never had a mechanical issue I couldn’t quickly solve, and handled every bit of drek thrown at us. So it didn’t take long for me to upgrade to the War Hound after they first came out. And you know what? They’re just as good, if not better than the original. But, I may be just a bit biased.  
> Rifleman  
> Nope, I agree with you here, omae. I’d also like to add how balanced this thing is in my arms, which makes CQB almost a dream.

### PSG ENFORCER II

Produced by Heckler and Koch (HK), the original Enforcer was the go-to anti-personnel rifle used by law enforcement and security providers worldwide. Approximately seventy-five percent smaller than most weapons in its class, the Enforcer was easy to transport in an (often-cramped) armored response vehicle. And while the Enforcer wasn’t the most accurate weapon system at extreme ranges, its uncanny accuracy at mid to long ranges made it exceptionally lethal in an urban setting where range wasn’t often that much of an issue. Many “threats” have been neutralized by a sharpshooter employing an Enforcer; some of them even lived. But the Enforcer’s most distinguishing feature is the patented dual-ammunition feed system linked to the weapon’s smartgun system. This allowed the operator to employ different ammo types in order to customize their response to whatever situation/threat they’re facing. Most often this was having one magazine loaded with lethal rounds, the other with less-lethal ones. This ability was only further enhanced with the recent introduction of ammo selection technology. To take full advantage, HK began production on the Enforcer II, with the first production runs being sent to law-enforcement providers across Europe, the Middle East, and certain regions of North America. In most respects, the Enforcer and Enforcer II are still the same weapon. The Enforcer II is a bit bulkier in order to house the ammo selection/feed system, which can now employ more than two different ammunition types. The Enforcer’s two clips are housed side by side in an expanded well just forward of the trigger guard. The operator can use the weapon’s smartgun system to select and load the desired ammunition type in order to engage their threat. In addition to the ammo-selection and smartgun systems coming standard, the Enforcer II also comes with a detachable targeting scope. Because of various contracts, the Enforcer and Enforcer II are technically not available for sale to anyone not affiliated with a law enforcement or security provider.

> “Anti-personnel” rifle is just a nice corporate term that sounds better on the evening newsfeeds than “sniper rifle.” But we know what the Enforcer really is and who it’s meant for: people like us.  
> Old Crow  

> Still, it’s a nice piece of hardware. Got a chance to shoot an Enforcer II a few months back; it doesn’t operate like a standard rifle, and that took some getting used to. But once you get the knack, it’s all soybutter.  
> Cayman  

> What do you mean, “it doesn’t shoot like a standard rifle?”  
> /dev/grrl  

> Unlike most rifles of its type, the Enforcer II doesn’t automatically chamber a new round. You have to mentally (or verbally, however you have it set up) command it to do so. This means a shooter doesn’t have to waste time ejecting a perfectly good round and loading another. Basically, you select, load, **then** shoot. Most of it’s just learning how to re-train your mind and muscle memory, which isn’t hard if you’re used to, say, bolt-action weapons.  
> Cayman  

> Means you’re not going to be rapid-firing, but this weapon system is about precision shooting anyway.

### RANGER ARMS M-1400 “SPRINGFIELD”

In 2077, as part of their acquisition spree, Ranger Arms secured the rights and designs to the Springfield M-1A, a century-plus-old sporting rifle (that was based off an old twentieth century military rifle) still being produced as a knock-off by multiple disreputable firearm companies spread across the Pacific Rim. At first, this move puzzled those in the firearms industry who wondered what could be gained by such an acquisition. In early 2080, Ranger Arms answered this question by revealing the M-1400 “Springfield” enhanced battle rifle. Based on both the M-1A and the older M-14 but made of modern materials, the M-1400 is a simple, reliable, and most importantly accurate weapon designed to provide EBR performance to individual shooters or units operating on a more conservative budget. Other than a precision barrel forged to mil-spec standards for enhanced bal-

listics, the rest of the M-1400 is made of reliable yet cost-effective materials. This also makes the M-1400 easy to repair and service.

> A lot of modern shooters scoff at the M-1400, thinking it nothing more than some kind of anachronism because of its simple throwback design. But the proof is in the performance, and the Springfield is a solid performer in all respects. Yeah, it may not come with all the usual bells and whistles, but anyone with a modicum of skill and/or a decent scope for longer ranges can do some serious damage with this rifle right out of the box.  
> Thorn

> With its performance not dependent on fancy targeting systems, the M-1400 is useful for “dark” operations where all Matrix access is severed or extremely limited. It’s also extremely customizable and can fit most accessories.

## SHIAWASE ARMS TACTICAL MODEL 73 "FATAL LIGHT"

In the early 2070s, Shiawase Arms partnered with subsidiary Nemesis and initiated a program called “Mobile Warrior.” Comprising a series of weapons, armor, and gear, the intent was to create a comprehensive, integrated combat system for the average soldier. The program never panned out because of massive cost overruns and problems with the armor and main communications gear. But the planned main weapons of Mobile Warrior, the Model 71 SMG and Model 73 “Fatal Light” assault rifle, were enough of a success that Shiawase Arms put them into full production. Like the 71, the Tactical Model 73 is packed with several advanced systems and ergonomic features to make it extremely user-friendly, reliable, and accurate in the field. But the 73’s designers also made several … curious design choices. First is the proprietary helical magazine that attaches below the buttstock, which has been known to not seat properly in the weapon, causing the powered feed system not to engage. And while the magazine can hold a staggering 100 rounds, these rounds are also basically high-powered, custom SMG rounds specially designed for distance and specific to the Model 73; they cannot be used in other weapons. But despite these apparent shortcomings, the 73 is a popular weapon with security and mercenary forces; it’s even rumored to be the top contender to become the new Imperial Japanese Military standard service rifle.

> It may not pack a lot of punch, but some units appreciate the 73’s ammo capacity and its ability for sustained automatic fire without reload.  
> Cayman

> In the field, the custom ammo is a logistical pain, not to mention the fact that the lack of punch hampers use in certain environments such as a jungle, where local flora can actually deflect the smaller-caliber rounds. Even pairing shooters carrying the 73 with troops holding heavier weaponry doesn’t offset this deficiency, IMHO.  
> Picador

> Just got word that the Imperial Japanese Military has awarded Shiawase the contract to make the Fatal Light the standard IJM service rifle. An official announcement should be made by week’s end.  
> Baka Dabora

> Guess they must have fixed any lingering issues. Or paid off the right people.

## SHIAWASE ARMS TACTICAL MODEL 69

Designed alongside other weapons of the “Mobile Warrior” program, the Model 69 is a hard-hitting anti-materiel rifle that’s also designed to operate in the sniper role, providing long-range precision fire to platoons or fire teams. Made of the same lightweight materials as the Model 71 and 73, the 69 was specifically designed for field use. Original models featured an integral weapons commlink, but as of 2076 these were removed from all current and future production models because of crippling glitches caused by harsh environments. To compensate, the commlinks were replaced with state-of-the-art smartgun targeting systems. Since then, field reports from users have been mostly positive about the weapon’s performance, especially with regard to its accuracy and high damage profile, which can be summed up in two words: “Holy frag!” But the one issue Model

**WEAPONS RACK // FIREARMS**


---


69 users constantly cite is the weapon’s long barrel, which sometimes can be a hindrance in certain tactical environments such as urban and jungle battlefields.

> Like any weapon, you have to play to its strengths. And in this case, it’s the fact that the 69 fires heavy 13mm rounds that put big holes in just about anything it hits. Find a nice nest and you can easily dominate a battlefield with this fragger. Grade-A Bang-Bang IMHO.

> Cayman

> Yeah, when armed with anti-vehicle rounds, this fragger seems especially adept at Swiss-cheeseing armored vehicles and coring engine blocks. I still want to find the fragger who one-shotted my Dodge Stallion!

> Turbo Bunny

> I feel your pain.

> Clockwork

> Right now the two biggest anti-materiel “kids” on the block are the Model 69 and the Barrett 122. Want to start an argument among shooters? Get them going on which one is better and why. Right now, I’m leaning toward the 69 because I can transport the thing a bit easier than the Barrett.

> Hard Exit

> The Model 69 is best at mid to long ranges, while the Barrett has just a bit more accuracy once you enter “extreme” territory.

> Rifleman

> Rumor has it that Shiawase challenged Barrett to a shoot-off to see who’s got the better gun. To date, Barrett has yet to reply.

### Ultimax 83

Not every independent contractor, security, or mercenary outfit can afford the latest and greatest in weaponry or gear. This is where weapons like the Ultimax 83 come in. With horrible ballistics and a simple laser sight being its only standard accessory, the Ultimax 83 is the ultimate in bargain-basement weaponry. But despite these drawbacks, the Ultimax 83 has some (shocking) positive attributes. First, it’s rugged, melee hardened, and can handle just about any environment it’s put into. Second, when it does hit, it hits *hard*. And third, it’s so damn cheap—more affordable than just about any other standard assault rifle, which is great when you need to equip a force quickly and on the cheap. This alone keeps Ultimax in production and in the field.

> This is also why you most often see it in the hands of militias or gangs. That, and when it does run out of ammo, the Ultimax 83 can be used as a club.

## Machine Guns

### Ares M-22A1 “Mad Mamma”

Leave it to Ares to take an already powerful weapon system and make it bigger in all respects just because they can. In the case of the M-22A1, that’s exactly what they did and then some. Based on the old Browning M-2 heavy machine gun that was often used as the primary weapon on light to medium vehicles, the M-22 concept was originally developed by Browning as a modern update of the classic weapon system. But through a series of legal maneuvers and back-door deals, Ares Arms managed to ~~steal~~ secure all rights to the M-22 platform. Now known as the M-22A1, the (ultra) heavy machine gun was initially produced exclusively for use by Ares’ Firewatch Special Forces units. The “Mad Mamma,” as it became known, saw extensive use during recent action in Detroit and quickly gained a reputation as a “bug killer.” After that little conflict, Ares Arms announced that the Mad Mamma would become available for limited sale to “preferred and qualified customers” by second-quarter 2081. However, a number of M-22A1s have been reported to already be available via gunrunners and black marketeers in North America and North Africa. Like its predecessor, the M-22A1 is not meant to be a person-portable weapon system, even as a crew-supported weapon. Its large size, weight, heavy caliber, and massive recoil can typically be handled only when the weapon is (securely) mounted to a vehicle or heavy combat drone or planted into the ground via tripod. There’s a reason it’s technically classified as an “ultra” heavy machine gun.

## Crackshot Arms Roaring Thunder

When it comes to firearms design, sometimes it takes years of R&D and substantial amounts of nuyen to test and finely tune a new weapon system for final production, to find any obvious (and potentially catastrophic) flaws while trying to enhance the platform’s positive features. The time it takes to accomplish this can be lengthy and costly as the final product comes into being. And then there are people who just slap drek together to see what it does, or because they’re fragging desperate. Both of these succinctly describe Crackshot Arms, a new weapons company (term used loosely) based out of Motor City. During the unpleasantness before Ares moved out, Crackshot’s owners/lead designers assembled a true firearms monstrosity that’s basically a tri-barrel rotary shotgun/LMG. Created to deal with the local hostilities, the prototype Roaring Thunder was cobbled together as desperation measure to help defend a civilian aid station. Even though its firepower and ability to spray ungodly amounts of buckshot or slugs downrange is impressive, the prototype was notoriously inaccurate, somewhat unreliable with the shot spread, and prone to breakdown. But, when it managed to hit, it usually obliterated the target. After hostilities were over, word of mouth about the Roaring Thunder spread, and locals wanted one of their own. After (somewhat) refining the weapon, they began selling it on the local shadow markets. The weapon itself is on the heavier end of the LMG spectrum, and at just over 1.25 meters long, it looks like a crude metal box with a tri-barrel assembly at the front end, a belt-feed mechanism in the middle, a handle/trigger assembly on the top, and an arm-brace to help the shooter with recoil. It should also be noted that the Roaring Thunder has next to no recoil compensation. Its high rate of fire makes it difficult to employ without some kind of gyro-stabilization, fixed position mount such as a tripod, or a high level of raw strength. The Roaring Thunder is a bare-bones weapon, but it can accept all standard modifications and applicable accessories.

> No sane person would take this into combat. The damage potential is high, but for some reason there is no consistency in the shot pattern. It either concentrates fire and blows the living hell out of something, or it goes wide and barely hits the target, if at all. But for some reason, this thing has become popular with certain sects and individuals within the shadow community.  
> Picador  
> This thing rules! Got my hands on one after some slag put one up as collateral during a poker game last month in Miami. Yeah, it bucks like a bronco with pepper-sprayed balls, but I **love** the fire rate and spread on this thing! I ended up mounting mine on the back of one of my speedboats—it makes a nifty anti-aircraft drone and anti-boarding system when you slap a smartgun system on it. Also good for keeping those damn seagulls from shitting all over my boat! Gonna get another soon to pair them up, overlap the fields of fire, different ammo types, the works!

# INGRAM BLACK KNIGHT

The last, and heaviest, of Ingram’s Knight MG line, the Black Knight is a beast even by heavy machine gun standards. Looking superficially like its sister MGs, the White and Grey Knights, the Black Knight is almost fifty percent bigger and comes in at just shy of 1.6 meters in overall length. Using heavy .50 caliber rounds, the Black Knight has a slightly slower rate of fire than most HMGs, but it makes up for this with an accuracy not found in most weapons of its class. Instead of having a standard recoil compensation system, the Black Knight features an advanced attenuated-barrel and hybrid gas-recoil system that keeps overall recoil to a minimum, allowing for optimum target acquisition, especially at long ranges. Weighing in at approximately thirty kilos, the Black Knight is often used as either a fixed weapon or mounted on a vehicle or drone. It should also be noted that despite its performance profile, the Black Knight can be extremely finicky and requires constant maintenance to ensure that all of its systems remain fully functional. The Black Knight also comes with smartgun and safe firing systems standard.

> — Clockwork

> Agreed, and they aren’t kidding about accuracy. You can put just a few rounds downrange and drill a target right good. I’d almost say this thing was like an EBR or sniper rifle in that respect.

# INGRAM GREY KNIGHT

The second in Ingram’s “Knight” line of MGs, the Grey Knight is a basic medium machine gun. Essentially a beefier, higher-caliber, belt-fed version of Ingram’s White Knight LMG, the Grey Knight was designed as a middle-ground weapon, typically for use as a crew-serviced weapon platform, or as a mounted weapon on a vehicle or drone. However, the Grey Knight has been employed solo by those of a more robust stature or with significant strength augmentations. Like the White Knight, the Grey Knight comes standard with the same recoil and ammo-feed system as well as a smartgun system. But the folding stock has been replaced with a detachable rigid stock that also holds a small weapon repair kit. And like the White Knight, the Grey Knight does not accept any additional modifications.

> And in the case of emergency, that detachable folding stock also makes a handy impromptu club, just sayin’. But I’ve also seen most people ditch the repair kit and add some other extras, like bits of C-12 for emergency use.  
> — 2XL

> I will say I’m impressed at the accuracy of this thing. The bolt action is extremely smooth. Combined with the recoil comp, there’s hardly any muzzle rise when you go full-bore. I’ve replaced most of our base sentry guns with Grey Knights and have yet to regret my choice.  
> — Picador

> Still, Ares is still not happy about this line. More than a few Ares Johnsons in North America have been putting out jobs for runs against Ingram. One would think they’d be worrying more about events in their new Atlanta home before getting back to their old dirty tricks.

# INGRAM WHITE KNIGHT  
## MOD 1 AND MOD 2

Like other Ingram MGs, the White Knight LMG has been a popular staple among military, paramilitary, and security forces for decades. With constant upgrades, it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Reliable and hard-hitting, the White Knight was also popular because it was considered deployable right out of the box, meaning all one had to do before going into combat was simply load it. Part of this was because of the standard features already built into the weapon: smartgun system, a high-rated recoil compensation system, and a detachable folding stock for storage and transport. Additionally, the latest versions of the White Knight feature a SOTA ammunition feed.

system that allows for precise targeting. But these features come at a cost. The White Knight is so precisely designed and engineered that it cannot accept any other internal modifications and has limited external space for mounting accessories. But because of its performance specs, many consider this a fair trade-off. However, three years ago Ingram announced the new “Knight” line of MGs. The first in this new line is the White Knight Mod 2. Almost exactly the same as its predecessor, the Mod 2 features a new detachable, interchangeable barrel system (with handle) that allows the White Knight to mount a shorter barrel, allowing it to be used more effectively in close quarters and in vehicles. While the shorter barrel changes the weapon’s range profile, it can easily be switched to the longer one for longer-range engagements. Otherwise, besides the barrel, all components of the original White Knight (known as Mod 1 to differentiate) and Mod 2 are completely interchangeable.

> Stone  

> There was some litigation filed concerning certain copyrights, but they ultimately were dismissed because it was determined Ingram hadn’t attempted to copy any Ares brand names, logos, trademarks, or products; and just the word “knight” was not copyrightable. That, and rumors suggested that Ares didn’t press **too** hard.

> Red Anya  

> Also, word of advice if you have a MOD 2, make sure you properly seat and secure the barrel **before** you fire. I don’t think I have to explain why. And if I do, don’t touch a firearm in my presence. Ever.

### SHIAWASE ARMS NEMESIS II

Named after the Greek goddess of divine justice and vengeance, the original Nemesis was designed to be a user-friendly, person-portable infantry squad support weapon. Built around a high-rated safe-targeting system, the idea was to help prevent friendly-fire incidents among lower-tier or less-experienced troops while still providing a solid weapon for higher-tier experienced ones. On many counts, the Nemesis was a success. Among the units it was designed for, reports indicated that friendly-fire incidents did in fact decline among those who used it. Although those same reports indicated that the safe-system was somewhat prone to hacking and that the ammo-feed system was extremely susceptible to foreign objects and debris. The new Nemesis II for the most part has corrected these problems but is now made of stronger, lighter-weight materials similar to those used in the proposed “Mobile Warrior” line of weapons. The result is a weapon system that is twenty-five percent lighter than its predecessor. While still a decent weapon system, these lightweight materials don’t handle recoil like the previous model, making the Nemesis II slightly less accurate in combat.

> Kind of makes that safe-system even **more** important if you ask me.  
> Cayman  

> Eh, not that big a deal. Slap on a bipod or find a way to brace it, and you’re fine. Not everything has to be so damn complicated.

## Assault Cannons

### Ares Arms Vigorous

Designed to be a direct competitor to the legendary Panther Assault Cannon, the Vigorous was plagued by poor word of mouth soon after its release. Subsequently, sales of the Vigorous tanked and production eventually slowed to a trickle, with barely a dozen being produced a month. In fact, Ares only continued production in order to satisfy various contracts with parts suppliers and had plans to scrap the line as soon as those contracts were met. But while the Vigorous was being slammed on the Matrix, social media, and any weapon outlet, those who actually purchased the weapon (at a massive discount) actually found it to be a solid performer in all aspects. Eventually word of mouth started to change, and the Vigorous’ reputation slowly began to shift. But entrenched opinions die hard, and the Vigorous still suffers from poor reception despite having proved itself multiple times in the field. Designed to be a bare-bones basic assault cannon, the Vigorous didn’t have any fancy targeting or recoil compensation systems common to other cannons at the time. Instead, the Vigorous was purposely built to be customized to its user’s specific preferences. As such, it’s extremely easy to modify and service in the field. Performance-wise, the Vigorous is on par with other assault cannons in terms of damage profile. But it suffers from some ballistic drop-off at longer ranges, which is one of the most common (and petty) criticisms levied against the weapon. The Vigorous doesn’t come with many standard features, but it has a rigid stock/shock pad and a bipod. If one can look past the bad press, the Vigorous is a reliable assault cannon for a discount price, but the low cost may not last much longer.

> You’re right about that not much longer thing. The tide is (slowly) starting to turn, and people are realizing that the venom levied against the Vigorous is largely bulldrek. Prices are slowly starting to rise as demand increases. Get them while you can, folks, we may have a bit of a comeback on our hands.

## Exotic/Special/Other Ranged Weapons

### Ares Charybdis

Designed to be the counterpart to the Ares Scylla, the Charybdis provides another non-lethal weapon. It’s essentially a massive water cannon, designed to be mounted on anti-riot vehicles, like a converted Ares Roadmaster. It sprays water using the Spray Attack rules (p. 117, SR6), and applies the Wet status to everything that the attack touches (ties go to the attacker rather than the defender).

This gun is intended to be mounted, and users need to have a Strength of 6 or higher to carry it. Otherwise, it must be fired from a mounted position. The Charybdis must draw water from a source, either provided in the vehicle or via an external source (such as a fire hydrant). The Charybdis cannot move more than 5 meters from the water supply. So long as the water supply is available, the Charybdis has unlimited ammunition.

# Ares Scylla

What would happen if you took a Tesla coil and attached it to the end of a barrel? Not much, normally. Tesla coils can’t really hurt anyone, and directing the charge would be almost impossible. However, the engineers at Ares have figured out how to amplify the electrical effects and direct it into a small “stream” of lightning, delivering Electric damage (p. 109, SR6) using the Spray Attacks rules (p. 117, SR6).

This gun is intended to be mounted, and users need to have a Strength of 6 or higher to carry it. Otherwise, it must be fired from a mounted position. The Scylla must be attached to a power source. The Scylla must draw power from a source, either provided by the vehicle or an external source (such as an industrial-grade electrical outlet). The weapon cannot move more than 5 meters from the power source. When attached to a vehicle, it draws electricity at a rapid rate, interrupting all other vehicle systems (meaning the vehicle must be stationary for the weapon to function). So long as the power supply is available, the Scylla has an unlimited ammunition capacity.

# Crackshot Arms Regulator 'Gun Gauntlets'

The only way to survive in the modern firearms industry is to either A) have a popular enough brand or product that everyone will follow/buy regardless of things like reliability or quality (corporate backing doesn’t hurt either) or B) provide something new or innovative. Crackshot Arms has put another entry into the gun race with something from option B, albeit barely. Their Regulator gauntlets aren’t actually a firearm but rather—as the advertising says—a “forearm mounting and deployment system.” Yeah, you read that right. The basic Regulator gauntlet uses a series of magnets and fasteners that can be reconfigured to hold (almost) any kind of firearm.

Actual operation is achieved *only* through the weapon’s smartgun/smartlink remote firing system option; standard operation is not possible when mounted. The gauntlets themselves provide a stable firing platform and are able to assist with dissipating recoil. On most gauntlets, there’s also space for one additional clip/magazine for quicker reload. Size is the primary factor in determining what class of weapon the Regulator can mount. For average-sized metahumans (dwarfs, elves, humans, orks) the Regulator can mount a firearm up to heavy pistol or machine pistol size. For troll-sized users, it can mount up to a standard assault rifle size.

> I’ll admit, I’m still on the fence about this one. I’ve used them on the range, and I was less than impressed. Depending on the weapon used, the mounting wasn’t perfect, and the weapon’s grip or magazine constantly snagged on things. I also worried accidently blasting my knuckles or fingers off in the heat of combat. The gauntlets seem like a gimmick to me, but maybe I’m too stuck in my ways to fully embrace it. But as of this posting, Crackshot is doing a brisk business with the Regulator, so what do I know?  
> — Hard Exit

> I get what you’re saying, but look at it from a troll perspective. With these, we don’t necessarily have to worry about getting re-tooled or custom/purpose-made weapons anymore. Yeah, we have to invest in the smartgun/link and have the right ’ware, but it’s nice not having to fiddle too much with a weapon that, in our hands, is about the size of a baby’s toy.

# CRACKSHOT ARMS 'THUNDER DAGGER' THRUST GRENADE

Some say the Thunder Dagger (ugh), or TD in certain circles, was designed by people who watched too many horror-trids and decided to make a classic vampire-killing stake in real life, but with a twist just because they could. The TD is an explosive weapon typically shaped like a spike, ranges from twelve to seventeen centimeters in length, and is specifically designed to be thrust into a target where a directional charge forces the explosive energy into said target for maximum damage. The TD otherwise operates like standard grenades and comes in fragmentation and high-explosive varieties. They can be armed either wirelessly or by depressing a special arming stud found at the base. For an extra 100 nuyen, Crackshot also offers a special reusable “combat handle” for the TD that can hold one grenade and detaches (which also arms the device) once the TD has been inserted into the target.

> Great, this is going to inspire a whole new crop of wannabe Infected hunters. Why won’t bad ideas like this just die?  
> Red

> This is one of those concepts that sounds goofy, but actually works well in the field. My unit has used a few of these as components in booby-traps to great effect on more than one occasion. And the relatively slim profile makes it easy to slip it into things over a round or fat standard grenade. You also don’t necessarily have to bury it in a target.

# HORIZON-FLYNN DEFENSE-COM COMMLINK WEAPONS

Not every job or operation requires a massive show of force; sometimes the job requires a high degree of stealth, subterfuge, and ability to blend in. Or sometimes, you just don’t want anyone to know you have a weapon. For those times, you may not even have the option of carrying anything that even *looks* like a weapon. This is where the Defense-Com line of commlink weapons comes in. Developed with assistance from renowned blade-master Dante Flynn, the Defense-Com (or D-Com) line has evolved significantly since its debut only three years ago. Horizon recently expanded the line with a new light pistol version to complement the original hold-out pistol, taser, and blade models. They’ve also released a garrote version, but that particular model isn’t publicly advertised.

While the first D-Com production run featured inert, non-functioning links, it was discovered that these devices still attracted too much attention. Newer models now hold functioning commlinks, but they are bare-bones models at best. Don’t rely on them doing much more than turning on and looking just good enough to fool inspectors. As for their main purpose, the hold-out pistol is as adequate as a hold-out can be (but now comes with more ammo), while the new light pistol packs a bit more damage and versatility if not ammo capacity. The taser/stun gun is also adequate but a little underpowered; Horizon still hasn’t quite figured out how to incorporate a better battery. The knife is solid, with a ceramic, nano-sharpened blade and a locking device that holds up even after extreme use. The new garrote can be a bit tricky to use at first, but with practice gets the grisly job done.

> I once had to complete a job using nothing but D-Com weapons. Not an ideal situation, but you sometimes have to work with what you’re given. The hold-out pistol works best when you load it with some kind of drug or toxin round; it just doesn’t have the necessary punch otherwise. The light pistol is an improvement, if nothing more than for the extended range. But the recoil is a bit snappy and takes a while to get used to. Frag the taser unless you really need it; use the stun gun feature whenever possible. A knife is a knife, but I found the garrote to be surprisingly effective. I even got a bonus from my contractor by showing them the target as they died via commlink call.

# Narcoject Hornet

In the mid-2040s and throughout the 2050s, the Narcoject brands of defensive tools (I can’t exactly call them weapons) were modest sellers with a dedicated customer base. By the 2060s, the defensive tools started to fall out of popularity and eventually disappeared from the market, save for a few bits of surplus here and there. The toxin/drug itself remained popular as a less-than-lethal alternative or when a target required capture and not elimination. Then, in the late 2070s, Narcoject (the company) found itself with a new CEO who quickly became a media darling and began pushing her brand like never before. The result was a relaunch of the Narcoject defensive tool line, starting with the Narcoject One. In early 2080, based on field reports and R&D, Narcoject began producing the new Hornet. Whereas the Narcoject One could only be used in extremely close ranges, the Hornet is able to reach ranges comparable to most light pistols. This is accomplished twofold: from a new enhanced gas-propulsion system, and updated darts that are specifically, aerodynamically designed to maximize the output from the new propulsion system. This also has the benefit of having their penetration power increased by forty percent over the Narcoject One, making them extremely accurate. Shaped like a flat pistol, the Hornet can carry eight darts in an internal magazine on the left side and one in the firing chamber. The chamber can be accessed by pulling the “slide” back, just like most semi-auto firearms. The miniature gas propellant tanks are concealed in the covered housing just under the barrel. Up to three additional darts can also be stored in the grip for emergencies. The two propellant tanks can fire up to ten shots each before having to be refilled or replaced. The Hornet can be equipped with an external smartgun system, laser sight, and all standard firearm mods, though none of these is included. But while the Hornet is an improvement over the Narcoject One, early evaluations say that the Hornet is somewhat on the fragile side and is prone to damage if dropped.

> Or any kind of aggressive jarring or impact. Most often, though, all you need is an armorer repair kit to fix the problem, which nine times out of ten is that the propellant tanks become misaligned. But make sure to check them for leaks if it happens. Nothing sucks more than having the dart ready to go, but nothing to send it on its way. But still, these things are an improvement over the One. I can’t recommend this enough!

# Paint Grenades

In a world of high-tech sensors, light-bending camouflage technology, magical spells that can render individuals literally invisible, and other such pains in the hoop, it’s nice to have a cheap, low-tech means to combat such things. Alternately, there are times when you simply want to slot someone off because you can. Or, because you simply think it’s fun. Enter: the paint grenade. A paint grenade is simply a grenade filled with paint that is kept under pressure until it’s deployed. Depending on the grenade’s yield, it can coat an area between two and five meters, revealing anyone using the aforementioned methods of concealment. Paint grenades come in a variety of colors, but most often they are some kind of obnoxious, extremely bright, glow-in-the-dark neon color that will stand out even in low-light conditions. But when that’s not enough, some paint grenades also include near-microscopic reflective matter (meaning glitter) that will reflect any light shined on it. And if that isn’t enough, you can also fill a paint grenade with a radioactive tracking dye included that can be detected by any Geiger counter readily available at any major store in the hardware section for only twenty-five nuyen. Thrown paint grenades come in two sizes: standard and large. These operate like standard explosive or less-than lethal grenades. A mini-grenade version for use in launchers is also available, but its splat range is significantly smaller than the standard paint grenade.

> Another fun feature is that if you’re lucky and want to add insult to injury, sometimes the paint grenades will also obscure things like smartgoggles, weapon scopes, smartgun optical sensors, and so on.

## SHIAWASE BLAZER

A classic, simple design for a flamethrower, combined with portable and easy-to-replace tanks, makes the Blazer a favorite for shadowrunners, deforesters, and military forces around the world. The newest design of the Blazer allows for the tanks to be swapped out even when being used.

The Blazer is small enough that it can be mounted with a standard weapon mount. When swapping tanks on the fly, the tank must be replaced within one Combat Round to make the switch seamless. Each tank can be used to make up to five Combat Rounds worth of attacks. Successful attacks from the Shiawase Blazer are treated as Fire damage (p. 110, *SR6*).

**Gamemaster note:** The damage and duration of the Burning status should be adjusted appropriately to the situation, but the recommended baseline is 4.

## SUNGARD JEWELRY

Produced by Aztechnology’s Dassault subsidiary, the Sungard Jewelry line comes in a wide variety of styles and shapes. The materials used are electrically capacitive, which allows a small pulse of electricity to be applied to generate light within the gem.

Sungard Jewelry can be used in three ways:

At the lowest setting, Sungard accessories can provide low-level light to the area immediately in front of the wearer and uses 1 charge per hour. The technology subtly enhances the attractiveness of the jewels. This gives the wearer a point of Edge in Social Tests where the jewelry may be noticed and impressive.

At the medium setting, the Sungard accessories provides full light to the area immediately in front of the wearer and uses 1 charge per half hour. The use of this level of illumination also makes the wearer easier to spot, and gamemasters should apply Edge, dice penalties, and dice bonuses as appropriate.

At the highest setting, the Sungard accessories strobe extremely bright light through the gems, turning the wearer into a walking flash-pak at the cost of 1 charge per Combat Round. Treat the effect as if a flash-pak were operating, with the wearer as the center of the effect. The wearer is immune to the flash-pak effects.

The jewelry has 10 charges; it recovers 1 charge per hour in sunlight, or 1 charge per minute when connected to a power source.

## LAUNCHERS

### KRIME THUMPER

Ever wanted to spray grenades at your foes with reckless abandon? Ever wanted to get the benefits of an airburst system without the cost? Ever wanted to throw massive pieces of shrapnel at someone? Look no further! Krime Has You Kovered™. The Krime Thumper is a triple-barreled grenade launcher capable of firing any variant of grenade, much like other grenade launchers. The Thumper has a unique fire mode, allowing all three barrels to fire at once. The grenades will land in an overlapping configuration, which increases the overall area of effect. Additionally, targets that are caught in the overlapping area get the effect of multiple grenades, each treated as a separate attack.

As if this wasn’t enough, Krime executives have recently heard rumors of street runners using the grenade launcher as a makeshift shotgun. They have loaded it up with Krime Kaltrops (each sold separately) and fired the balls of slivered metal at targets to devastating effect.

The Thumper is incapable of accepting ammunition that is not a grenade or explosive.

# Explosives and Scatter Weapons

## Caltrops

Technically caltrops are not grenades or explosives, but they utilize similar mechanics and serve a similar purpose to those items. Little triangular-shaped pieces of metal designed to impede or prevent the movement of a person through an area, caltrops have been used for centuries. They are one of the most basic area-denial munitions that exists, and functionally they have not needed to change much in all that time. Caltrops spread themselves out over an area and apply their damage to anyone who enters the area of effect. At the end of every Combat Round, anyone who moved through the area of effect must resist damage from the caltrops. Particularly vicious users of caltrops will coat the metal in poison, which applies its effects to any target damaged by the caltrops.

Spotting caltrops is difficult, requiring a Perception + Intuition (2) test to see them.

## Chemical Grenade

At its heart, a grenade is just an empty shell with a small explosive charge inside that turns the metal casing into damage-causing shrapnel. However, things get interesting when that shell is filled with something even worse than metal. That’s the case behind these insidious grenades. The shells are filled with a highly corrosive liquid substance, and when the explosive goes off inside, it disperses this corrosive liquid to everything within the blast radius.

Chemical grenades do their damage as Chemical damage (p. 109, SR6).

> Gamemaster note: The damage and duration of the Corrosive status should be adjusted appropriately to the situation, but we recommend that the baseline value for the Corrosive status effect should be **4**.

## Cryo Grenade

One of the newer grenade inventions, the cryo grenade disperses aerosolized liquid nitrogen into the blast radius. This results in a sort of flash-freeze effect, which causes everything within the blast radius to become either frozen or at least cold. The technology is still relatively new and has had to overcome several technical challenges. Despite this, the grenades are still making their way into the shadows and have proven more effective than not.

Cryo grenades do their damage as Cold damage (p. 110, SR6).

## Glitter Grenade

While the glitter grenade is not an explosive, the method by which it works is almost identical to explosive grenades. When the grenade is activated, a motor inside spins up and flings glitter and metal fragments into the area around the point of explosion. This causes anything invisible to become visible and makes it easy to identify and target those affected by the glitter grenade.

Glitter grenades don’t do damage on their own. Those affected by the glitter grenade lose Invisibility or Improved Invis-


---


ibility statuses. Anyone attacking a target affected by a glitter grenade gets a point of Edge during their attack.  
The materials within the glitter grenade can be adjusted with an Engineering (5, 5 minutes) Extended test. The materials must be small, dry, metallic particles, similar to glitter. This can be done to make the grenade exploit a weakness or allergy, but it requires pre-planning.  
Removing the glitter requires an extensive and thorough shower, and sometimes a vacuum cleaner. Magic can help—Animate Metal can be used to make the glitter dance away.

## INCENDIARY GRENADE

Made by manufacturers all over the world, the standard incendiary grenade does one job: It lights things on fire. Modern advancements have not changed the overall concept much. Instead, the updates simply make the incendiary explosive much more effective. First, the grenade sprays the area with a flammable gas, then it releases white phosphorous, igniting the gas and causing anything flammable to catch fire.  
Incendiary grenades do their damage as Fire damage (p. 110, SR6).  
*Gamemaster note:* The damage and duration of the Burning status should be adjusted appropriately to the situation, but the recommended baseline value for the Burning status effect should be 4.

## KRIME KALTROPS

A business that operates as fast and loose with accepted manufacturing practice as Krime is bound to have excessive waste. Krime executives realized that they had good slag metal just lying around the shop floors and decided to find a better use for it. Thus, the Krime Kaltrop was born. While a regular caltrop is made of dainty, hard-to-spot metal slivers, the Krime Kaltrop takes all subtlety out of the equation. A twelve-pointed metal sphere of spikes about 5 centimeters in diameter, the Krime Kaltrop is capable of shredding a foot, tire, or even a tracked vehicle’s tread. Damage is applied at the end of any Combat Round in which a target moves over the Kaltrops, and at the end of any Combat Round in which the target is still in the area of effect.  
Their ungainly construction makes Krime Kaltrops easier to see than normal caltrops—they require only a Perception + Intuition (1) test.

## NANO GRENADE

The most cutting-edge technology and the newest designs in grenades allowed Evo to create something that most people would try to avoid with a three-meter pole. Despite the apprehension of the public in using nanotechnology, Evo has still mass-produced these grenades and is actively marketing them to those who can afford them. One should assume that most Evo forces will carry at least a few of these in their ranks.  
Nano grenades can emulate the effects of fragmentation, high explosive, incendiary, and zapper grenades. The nanobots within the liquid magnetic suspension receive a wireless command from the grenade’s owner and create the necessary materials to replicate the effects of the designated design. This means that the grenade must be wirelessly active in order to receive the command, and that it takes 1 Combat Round to “prime” the grenade, after which the grenade can no longer accept commands to change the contents.

## NOISE GRENADE

Similar in many ways to the flash-pak, the noise grenade is intended to non-lethally incapacitate a foe. It has similar dimensions to a flash-pak, but instead of having strobing light effects, the noise grenade is designed to generate a wide range of sounds across the lower parts of the aural spectrum. The sounds generated can cause disorientation within the blast radius, and in some cases can cause extreme nausea to occur.  
Those within the Ground Zero range suffer from the Nauseated and Dazed status effects (p.



---


52, SR6). Those outside of the Ground Zero range suffer from the Dazed status. Targets with Audio Dampening augmentations, or currently under the Silent or Silent (Improved) status, are treated as being one range category further away than they physically are. The device has ten charges and uses one charge per Combat Round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge per ten seconds.

## THERMOGRAPHIC FLASH-PAK

A variation on the standard flash-pak, the thermographic version emits intense infrared pulses, causing those with thermographic vision to suffer the effects of the flash-pak. Those without thermographic vision are spared the effects. The thermographic flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds.

*Wireless bonus:* The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong infrared flashes at the subscribed character, preventing any status for them. The device can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour.

## ZAPPER GRENADE

The zapper grenade discharges a massive pulse of electricity within its blast area. The capacitor that delivers this pulse is burned out after a single explosion, but when applied to the correct target, the electrical effects can be long-lasting.

Zapper grenades do their damage as Electrical damage (p. 109, SR6).

## DIRECTIONAL MINE MODIFICATION

Essentially, a directional mine is a grenade with a special triggering mechanism. This “modification” is just a shorthand way to describe a directional mine that has the properties of a grenade. A directional mine can be loaded with any of the explosives and contents of a grenade. A directional mine is activated by a trigger, often a tripwire that ensures a target is within range. This tripwire can be a laser (visible, ultraviolet, thermographic) or a physical wire. The blast radius for a directional mine describes a forty-five-degree cone extending from Ground Zero.

## GECKO GRIP MODIFICATION

Gecko grip adhesive can be used to adhere an explosive to a surface. This methodology is similar to the techniques used by limpet mines, using magnetism to adhere a mine to a ship. The gecko grip material is applied to the casing of any grenade or mine, making the explosive stick to the surface of the first thing it touches. This can be tricky when throwing a grenade, resulting in an Attack Rating penalty of 2. When launched, the adhesive activates when more than 5 meters from the launch point. Breaking free of the gecko grip’s adhesive requires a Strength + Body (4) test.

# AMMO

The following rule applies for all ammunition: Ammo can only modify an attribute that already exists. If a weapon does not have an Attack Rating at a certain range category, using ammo with a bonus to that category has no effect.

## HANDLOADED AMMO

With a little extra care and TLC, a good gunsmith can handload their own ammo. This extra effort provides a decent boost across the board with a well-seated slug and hand-selected powder weight and grains. You’d be amazed at how often the powder load has foreign matter in it throwing off the burn.

A perfectly weighted and seated slug and powder that is sifted grain by grain makes this ammo the best you can buy for accuracy over distance.

# rEVOlution ARMS

**POSTED BY: ARMAND**

People and miscreants of the shadows, let me be the first to give you the full introduction to rEVOlution Arms! Yup, it’s right there in the name, Evo is getting into arms and creating a stir. If you’ve got a clean enough SIN, toss some nuyen into the market behind this moniker. Just keep a close eye on them, because somewhere down the line every star falls, and this one is burning bright and hot!

Since I thought rEVOlution’s catalog lacked some excitement, I slipped a few samples out to folks I trust and let them play with them in the field. They came back with their own snippets and

> My simple rule of life is: The louder the hype, the less I believe.  
> Cayman

## GAMEMASTER NOTE

All rEVOlution Arms weapons were designed by Monads, which means two things:  
First, they’re a little unpredictable, so all of them use the wild die when attack rolls are made. Replace one of the dice from your attack dice pool with the wild die.  
Second, Monads get a special bonus with them. Monads can use a Minor Action to make the wild die be rerolled. This makes these weapons better in their hands but worse in the hands of others.

I opened up the thread on my host to some trusted posters who’ve handled them. 2080 looks like a potentially wild new year for arms.  
Look out, Ares, there’s a rEVOlution in the works!

## REVOLUTION ARMS IRON BEAR COMBAT AXE

Wallacher better watch their hoops. The Iron Bear is a lightweight titanium double-bladed axe with a meter of razor-sharp edge divided between the twin heads. It lacks the spike but makes up for it with a thick-handled base that can be used for less-than-lethal takedowns—unless you’re a troll with swing control issues.

# REVOLUTION ARMS STEEL CLAW COMBAT BROADSWORD

I’m thinking this design is going to be taking over from the classic katana as the blade of choice for street swordmasters. Everyone with a trid sees the sword fights with all those blocks and sword clashes, but anyone trained in the blade knows you don’t dull your edge like that—unless you have the Steel Claw. Another smart-material masterpiece, the blade knows when it’s on the offensive and when it’s blocking based on your pre-programmed fighting style, providing quite the edge against an ill-prepared foe.

# REVOLUTION ARMS IRON HAWK COMPOSITE BOW

rEVOlution is mastering the concept of building a better mousetrap while using classic concepts plus some solid innovations. The Iron Hawk is a classic compound bow with a twist. In this case, it’s the arrows and the bow together. Iron Hawk arrows are heavier than standard models but contain a small thruster in the shaft that’s ignited by the pressure of the launch. The thruster helps compensate for the weight-to-power issues, allowing the heavier arrow to hit harder and travel farther.

# REVOLUTION ARMS RAVEN

The light-pistol market is pretty saturated with quality arms, but Evo didn’t want to leave any gaps in their arsenal, so they ventured forth. The Raven only comes in one color: black. To distinguish this pistol from others, Evo went with tech theft rather than innovation. Unless you believe the internal memos that claim Ares stole the tech and sabotaged Evo’s production. The point is, the Raven has the same ammo swap feature as the Predator VI.

Machine pistols are too often afterthoughts or mods that don’t really offer quality with their quantity of bullets. The Ocelot is looking to change that, with a focus on building a quality standalone machine pistol from the ground up. Reminiscent of the mini Uzi of last century, the Ocelot offers quality on its own rather than serving as an add-on to another model.

# REVOLUTION ARMS IRON EAGLE

Orks and trolls rejoice, there is a heavy pistol you can pretty much call your own again. This monster offers power unattained by other semi-auto heavy pistols but leaves those with a smaller frame a bit the worse for wear after too much time behind the trigger.

# REVOLUTION ARMS CHEETAH

Like its namesake, the Cheetah isn’t about power, but makes a fine demonstration of how speed kills. Designed with a specialized firing system that offers an unmatched rate of fire, the Cheetah offers burst options that stack bullets within centimeters of one another. Sustained fire isn’t an option yet, but rEVOlution is looking to change that.

# REVOLUTION ARMS BLACK WOLF

Another saturated and well-covered market left Evo with a need for innovation, and innovate they did. They may have innovated themselves right out of the race, though, because their price point and small production runs thus far aren’t getting them a lot of customers.

> You can thank Ares for those production issues. They hit Evo where it hurts, and the run got some news footage in Pretoria, with the runner team all sporting Optimums. Well played, Ares, well played.

Not sure if it was just a last-minute thing or if no one at Evo considered the shotgun as a place for innovation. The Iron Bull has some aesthetic advances, but internally it’s little more advanced than any of its combat shotgun counterparts. Pretty isn’t going to kill your enemies.

# REVOLUTION ARMS STEEL TIGER

I respect the effort to make a rifle of this level that isn’t some bulky beast. She may lack a little grip versatility, but this class of guns isn’t designed to be versatile. It’s just supposed to drop a target from a thousand meters, then drop another target, and another target, all before anyone hears that

## rEVOlution Arms Rhino, Behemoth, Juggernaut

I got to handle and test the full spectrum of “machine guns.” The nice thing about the design plan from rEVOlution is that they thought about the user, but didn’t try to build all these big guns with the assumption that an ork or a troll is going to be running the heavy ordnance. First off, the adjustable handle plan is great for swapping the Rhino and Behemoth between hip and shoulder fire, while the same system on the Juggernaut seemed like some kind of joke. Then again, firing a gun of that size anywhere but on a mount is a bit ridiculous.

The Rhino is a tight shooter with enough weight trimmed that firing it like an AR isn’t out of the question. Your arms will tire if you get into a sustained engagement like that, but the Rhino is great for ending those kinds of engagements quickly. The Behemoth can come up to the shoulder, but you better have a ledge to lay her on for anything past a single spray and pray. rEVOlution trimmed some mass with their production and they pull off a good bit of fluff while integrating protective and ergonomic features into the same package. Barrel heat can be a problem, but they made sure all the grips and shields were in all the right places to keep those precious fingers from getting barrel-fried.

Mounted, they all operate like a dream. Recoil evaporates, weight is well balanced to the connection point, and you’d swear the bullets gain a guidance system as the weapon settles comfortably into pouring a river of bullets downrange. That said, they jam more often than other designs, and I can’t find the culprit mechanism.

## rEVOlution Arms Megaladon

A panther has nothing on a Megaladon! You might as well trademark that slogan right now and figure out a couple dozen other witty ad taglines, because rEVOlution is going to need them. If they can maintain production, this gun will be taking over the market (it’s a small market but hey, product placement). They gave it a big name, and “The Meg” has become the go-to street reference, but overall they seem to have focused a bit too much on ergonomics and not enough on economics. Unless the goal was to make a trophy gun that can put a hole in anything, the biggest drawback is going to be sales (based on price).

> I’ll spend the money to get my hands on an anti-materiel weapon that I can shoulder fire—I’m human and weigh 62 kilos, so I’m not some hulking brute. The weight and balance is perfect, though it takes a little getting used to.  
> — Whistler

> Thanks for info that isn’t informative. The Megaladon is designed like a shoulder-fire weapon with a shoulder tucked component. It is still ambidextrous thanks to the brilliant minds at Evo, and as Whistler proudly highlights, it’s designed for anyone.

# REVOLUTION ARMS PULSE

With the Polymodal Ulterior L S Emitter (the PULSE), Evo veered away from both the animal names and the standard arms-race plan. This weapon is clearly the first step in a massive non-lethal arms race that rEVOlution will be spurring on. The Pulse is a straight-up knockout punch for anything with a brain. At its highest setting, it will blackout just about anyone or anything, but even on its lowest setting, it at very least discourages people from further engagement. Designed as a stun gun for the brain, the weapon fires a pulse of energy in a wavelength specifically focused on disrupting neural pathways. Low levels just leave you a little dazed, making it hard to think, but the higher levels will black you out and, if street testing is to be believed, can possibly cause permanent neurological damage. Based on the emitter and a pistol variant in the works, miniaturization is rapidly progressing, and a wide-area version, such as a grenade, is quite possible in the near future.

# REVOLUTION ARMS HELL TURTLE

It’s a funny name but a hell of a weapon. The name comes from the alternate extended fuel source, a backpack with a design taken from a turtle shell with individual compartments that are separated and sealed off if the pressure in a chamber alters quickly from a rupture. The thing has almost no risk of a catastrophic failure from a standard impact, but certain rounds can ignite a tank and cause a rupture that cascades between the cells. Without the turtle pack, the ammo supply is limited but not too small. It depends on your attack style and whether you’re a fan of the spray-and-pray method or prefer the focused burn. The adjustable choke is a nice touch as well, especially since it allows a wide but heavy spray without the risk of wide swings in the area of effect. The smartlink system is great for identifying the spray area and allowing a safer attack. This thing certainly changed my views on smartlinking a weapon similar to a flamethrower.

> The smartlink setup is great for burn art. I program the spray and can flash burn patches to form images for my graffiti pieces.

# REVOLUTION ARMS HONEY BADGER

Every time I toggled the trigger, my mind went back to the old advert links I found when I started searching “Honey Badger.” Every one said “Honey Badger don’t care,” and looking into this pre-Awakening psycho predator, I get the name. This thing launches and sometimes it flies true, but other times it just dips a bit off course and blasts anything in its way. The fin design seems to be the fatal flaw, but not every time. Sometimes it just goes after something else, because, well, Honey Badger don’t care!

# REVOLUTION ARMS TARANTULA HAWK

On the other hand, I also got to test out this beauty, and I did it in what had to be the best way ever for its namesake—I swatted bugs in Chicago. The place isn’t overrun with them, but that made it easier to hunt and test rather than fighting for my life against the hordes! The targeting system software is top-notch, and rather than using just heat or straight radar, the lock-on process involves

a shape and background temperature variation analysis that makes this system tough to trick, even with a full array of countermeasures. The design was nice as well, with a relatively simple reloading system. It is best run through a better protected network, as all that software requires big computing power, and protection is a must since the warheads can get spoofed with new target signatures if the firewall is bypassed.

## rEVOlution Arms Crimson Wasp

For years, the laser market has been a very narrow field, with research and manufacturing cost keeping most other arms companies out of the game. Even those that reverse-engineered someone else’s design still had a hard time getting a budget to build them for the limited market. This weapon offers competition and innovation on the current market leader, along with a strong market in the ever-growing space operations field, which is Evo’s primary reason for focusing on this weapon.

A familiar design and operation style make this laser ideal for classically trained soldiers. The battery pack changes out just like a removable magazine, the ergonomics of the gun remind the user of its minimal recoil, and the sighting system aligns with the “barrel” in order to increase accuracy. Like most laser weapons, they have fantastic accuracy at range but lose beam focus, and thus damage, over distance. But since modern armor is not designed for heat and radiation energy dissipation, the trade-off is often worth it.

* While rEVOlution is starting with the “Crimson” and “Red” names, they already have designs that use a different wavelength to alter color.  
* Plan 9  
* Rumors abound about a “Black” line that uses a wavelength outside the normal visible range. They say it comes with a

## rEVOlution Arms Red Fox

I was impressed with the Wasp, but I am in love with the Fox. The extended barrel adds beam focusing that pushes the effective range past any other laser on the market. It still suffers from particulate disruption over distance, but rEVOlution did something in the design to mitigate that. The look and feel are also awesome, with the same battery exchange style to give it a more classic rifle feel and a sharp design to fit its futuristic operation.

> I watched a misfire once—the gun melted. They’re built tough, but a hard jostle could put the emitters out of alignment, causing a myriad of issues, the worst of which is a catastrophic meltdown.

# Ammo

## rEVOlution Arms rEVO rounds

I’m not exactly sure why they found it necessary to develop an updated version of what looks like the old Firepower ammo, but they have. This cased ammo uses a proprietary chemical combination for the propellant and the slugs themselves are nanomanufactured with a unique bonding structure that holds together to punch through armor, but also fragments when hitting soft tissue, even if it hits the tissue instead of armor. Every box comes with a warning saying that the round cannot be taken apart without the propellent being ignited in order to prevent reverse engineering. You can’t pull out the slug to analyze its structure, and you can’t get access to the chemical propellent. This ammo is shrouded in a level of mystery that makes it both highly sought after but also feared by those who are worried about what manufacturing and nanotech were required to make a round like this.

**Note:** rEVO rounds use the wild die.

* The secret is nanites. The slug has them embedded in the design, and a few loose ones are in the propellent case to ignite if the pressure changes. Hitting them with an EMP has had mixed results for being able to get into the rounds. I have several propellent and slug samples available to the right buyer, but they’ll cost big nuyen. Early testing cost me a hand, and the later work caused plenty of equipment damage.

* Armand

* Are we trying to kick off the nanite hysteria again? Ninety-nine percent of nanotech is totally harmless, and most of it is beneficial. That remaining fraction is offensive tech. The problem wasn’t the tech itself, it was the abuse and misuse of the tech. And actually, it was the abuse and mistreatment of misunderstood AIs. If we were more humane in our treatment of other sapient beings, we’d avoid the problem in the first place.

* Icarus

* You all must spend your time in the first world. Head out to those places that had cheap nanoconstruction and see what kind of damage was left behind from CFD fallout. Many of these places weren’t in great shape in the first place, and now they’re death traps. Corps are snatching up property in these areas in order to use the natural decay around them as a first line of defense.

* Picador

> Now that everyone has hyped this rEVOlution Arms drek through the roof, we should open some closets and reveal a few skeletons. First of all, every bit of this is coming from tech and design specs from the headcases—Monads—that Evo has taken in in droves. Or more accurately, that worked their way into Evo because it’s easy for freaks to hide amongst their fellow freaks. They are also the executives and top dogs all over rEVOlution and the Evo Arms division they created for this risky endeavor. What makes it risky? The fact that none of the other arms companies wants to lose even a fraction of their markets, and every one of them has better connections with mercs and runners than rEVOlution. That’s a lot of heat that will be coming their way before too long.

> Next issue—and I’m going to catch drek on it, but I’m used to that for spilling chiptruth while everyone else is trying to make friends with the monsters of this new world—is the kill switch. Yup, they’ve got a kill code embedded in the base programming for all these weapons that allows Monads to shut the guns down. Don’t believe me, take one on a headcase hunt. You’ll find out it’s not just the ones working for Evo, but all of them, worldwide. They’ve shared the secret code through their Null Sect buddies, and now every Monad and headcase on the planet can shut these guns down and access an info network that helps them stay ahead of their hunters.

> Clockwork

> I can see how some people don’t appreciate the success this represents, but for them to think this division is going to fall from external efforts by other arms manufacturers is pure fantasy. If rEVOlution fails it’s because they’re attacked internally. Right now, reVOlution is making bank and has massive operating funds because they’ve got the revenue stream coming from Monad tech. Problem is, the rest of the company is not happy about that tidbit and they’re looking at rEVOlution and the entire Evo Arms division as a potential flight risk. Get big enough making advanced tech, and everyone else is going to be looking to snatch away the goose that’s laying all those shiny orichalcum eggs. The biggest issues headed for rEVOlution are going to come from internal ops to siphon off funds or cut far enough into their operations to shift the black ledgers red and get the rest of Evo coming in to rescue their flailing division.

# SUIT UP

> Now that we’ve waded through some of the weapons one can employ to take out their fellow metahumans, it’s time to examine the other side of the combat coin and look at something that (should) work to keep you alive: armor. But aside from (hopefully) being that which comes between you and an untimely demise, armor also serves other functions and assists the modern combatant in other ways while trying to survive whatever combat zone or fragged-up situation you find yourself in.

## Rifleman

### Ares “Bug Stomper” MK II Armor

Considered by some to be the pinnacle of modern armor designs, Ares’ “Bug Stomper” tactical armor system was designed with the sole purpose of allowing Firewatch operators to go mano-a-mano with bugs of all kinds and have a reasonable chance of survival. Until recently, very little was known about the armor system, as Ares kept the specs a closely guarded secret. But after recent events, more information about the Bug Stomper system has come to light. Made of extremely durable and lightweight materials, Bug Stomper armor is approximately the size of medium mil-spec but only three quarters the weight. Special joint systems also allow for unrestricted, smooth movement. Some variants can deploy one micro and one small drone. But by the time the debacle in Detroit went down, Ares was already on the Mark II. Deployed for testing in select units, this model features special “reactive” armor plates that can be applied to the legs, torso, and arms. While Ares still has no plans to put the Bug Stomper on the open market, many suits (or pieces of) have been popping up on the black markets and have been fetching extremely high prices; IF one can even find them.



---


> Buyer beware; most of the suits currently available and their components were scavenged directly from the battlefields in Detroit. Who knows how functional they truly are or if they’re still even combat-worthy. Best advice is that if you happen across one or its components; sell it and buy something more reliable.

Also known as “combat fatigues,” BDUs are either a pair of matching pants and a long-sleeved shirt or a jumpsuit. BDUs have been a staple of military and paramilitary units for over one hundred and fifty years (give or take), are made of durable, breathable, and (relatively) comfortable materials, and are designed for general everyday use. Although made with Kevlar-weave to provide some basic protection against smaller caliber weapons, BDUs are often used as the basic undergarment for higher-rated armor systems. As a utility garment, most BDUs feature several pockets and pouches on the arms and legs for equipment storage. They are also extremely popular with civilians because of their durability, utility, and military styling.

## MIL-SPEC ARMOR

> “Top of the line,” “state of the art,” and “bleeding edge” have all been used to describe mil-spec armor types. Mil-spec armor is the stuff one sees slugging it out in open combat and is typically only issued to elite units. Everything about mil-spec armor is designed to give as much protection as possible. Mil-spec armor comes in three basic types: light, medium, and heavy. Light is typically used by operators who need more mobility, medium is the standard issue that balances mobility with protection, while heavy suits tell the concept of mobility to go straight to hell. Exact specs vary, but all mil-spec armors utilize some kind of lightweight metal in various configurations and thickness as the primary layer of protection. Mil-spec suits are purpose built and cannot be combined with any other armor systems except personal augmented or magical enhancements. Standard armor modifications can be added as well. Every set of mil-spec armor is custom-fit specifically to the user and features powered micro-servo joints that allow for maximum ergonomics. Mil-spec armor comes in a variety of styles and colors depending on the military and unit that deploys it. Custom helmets packed with the latest in sensor and communications gear are often employed as well.  
> There are three major downsides to using mil-spec armor. The first is cost; most mil-spec armor is out of the price range of most shadowrunners and even most mercenary units. Second, it’s highly restricted and regulated; if you’re not part of a military, have the proper (and up-to-date) security credentials, or a private military contractor in good standing (key words there) with the International Mercenary Association, expect to have a giant bullseye on your back *every time* you wear your precious suit. And three, the medium and heavy armors trade at least some mobility for protection.

> Mil-spec armor is great for what it’s intended for, but it still surprises me how many runners keep trying to get hold of it for shadowrunning. Yes, it provides superior protection … for a while, until someone panics and brings out the heavy artillery. Being an ammo-magnet is never an enviable position to be in.

### Modular Equipment Mounting System (MEMS)

MEMS isn’t an armor system in itself—it’s a basic harness and a series of secondary add-on attachments to heavier armors (security rated and above). Basically, MEMS is meant to help store and carry all the stuff on the armor system’s outside without having to modify the armor further. The MEMS system allows users to place weapon holsters, ammo pouches, and various equipment pouches in whatever location they desire based on their specific needs and preferences. This allows for greater ease of access and use. In a world of combat where milliseconds make the difference between life and death, it is a definite advantage.  
MEMS attachments include: standard or quick-draw holster (up to heavy pistol), ammo pouches (by weapon type), an individual shotgun shell loop holster, medkit pouch, tactical sling attachment, or equipment pouch (by type).

> You see MEMS used a lot by tactical response teams in conjunction with their security-rated armor systems, which has essentially all but replaced the purpose-built “SWAT”-style armors in most emergency response units. Funny thing, though, most of these teams tend not to carry excess ammo or weapons but rather use MEMS to carry extra medkits.  
> Hard Exit

### MEMS TACTICAL ARMOR VEST

Filling a niche between purpose-built obvious tactical armors and concealed armor systems, the MEMS tactical vest is for when you may need to start out with subtlety, but then have to quickly transition to something that provides more substantial protection, mobility, and tactical flexibility. An armored version of the MEMS system, the tactical armor vest (or simply tac-vest) comprises modern Kevlar-weave plates encased in a vest-like carrier that goes over the front and back. Even when fully loaded, the tac-vest can be easily stored in a vehicle or small suitcase and then quickly employed when needed.

> These are a favorite with escort and protection specialists for when they don’t necessarily care about subtlety, don’t want to go overboard, but do care about things such as ammo capacity and protection in potential hot zones. They’re also more comfortable and easier to use than most other armors in their class, which is a big bonus when you’ve been traveling for hours on end in a cramped vehicle or aircraft.

# MURDER ARMOR

This stuff was a kitschy gimmick right up until Corinne Potter, a Seattle gubernatorial candidate at the time, took some shots right in the chest as part of an ambush, and then stood up on live trid, dusted herself off, and thanked Horizon for the fantastic protective wear. She avoided calling it by its brand name, but everyone knew what she meant. Few people care that the name’s a little vulgar; they just care that they can take a round, feign injury, and let their security detail deal with the rest.

> Love when the political stage is used for advertising. This stuff is not designed to take high-caliber rounds. This was a show of Barnum & Bailey proportions.

**Notes:** Characters shot while wearing Murder Armor may use a Minor Action to play dead with an opposed Con + Charisma vs. Perception + Intuition Test with a -4 dice pool modifier on the attacker. Success means the attacker ignores the character, assuming they are down, effectively giving them the Invisible 4 status. If the user makes an attack on their previous attacker, the Invisible status is lost after the attack. Murder armor simulates injuries with built-in Gorepaks, which must be replaced after each use. This costs 200¥ and requires an Engineering + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. Gorepaks cost 200¥.

# SECURETECH ARMOR AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (AAS)

While they struggle in other areas, several Ares execs have found ways to keep the nuyen flowing toward lost causes. The “acquisition” of the “Securetech” brand (notice the lack of a capital T) is allowing them to bolster their armor line even further, thanks to some serious rip-offs. The AAS resembles the PPP system and includes additional padding and armor for gaps in some standard armor or key points to protect. They are still quality, but the real SecureTech is making it rain in the shadows to frag Ares on this, and the runners enjoying the windfall don’t care one way or the other. Ego is great for the bank account!

# PARASHIELD "MYSTIC TOUGH" BODY ARMOR

The Sixth World is certainly a place of mayhem and magic. Technology has long tried to take the edge away from its mortal foe, especially in the arena of defenses for the mundane. Parashield has taken their expertise in paranormal critter training and physiology and merged this data with the basics of ballistic protection to create materials that stop bullets as well as they stop blasts of mana.

# SECURETECH SKINSHIELD

Obviously Ares got more from SecureTech (capital T) than just the PPP data. They also snagged some data on the ruthenium-enhanced SecondSkin line and have merged it all to make the SkinShield system, the next level of clandestine protection. The ruthenium system is upgraded to not just appear nearly invisible but also to alter skin tone for the perfect tan or ghostly pallor, add tattoos for that bit of edge, or, if you have a decent hacker, make you mostly transparent.

# SECURITY ARMOR

Built on the merger of civilian and military needs, this stuff is a fair middle ground for those who want the protection of military-grade tech, but without all the additional bells and whistles. Thus far, this stuff is mainly seen on private security forces working convoys for rich corporate clients, but those security forces aren’t always corp employees and sometimes runners don’t mind taking their payment in the form of premium gear.

While corpsec and military forces might want their armor to have some intimidation factor, executives and their protection specialists want no sign of their own personal fear while still being protected from whatever may come.

# STYLE ARMOR

Image is everything. At least, that’s what the corps and the media want us to believe. The thing is, most of the average people on the street out there buy it hook, line, and sinker. Weaving kevlar, spidersilk, and nano-polymers together into well-tailored fabrics is a pivotal area of success for megacorps wanting to intertwine protection and fashion. That said, between stopping bullets and turning heads, the former is the easier.

# SOCIAL RATING FROM ARMOR

Armor now offers a bonus Edge in social encounters when comparing a Social Rating created by the Charisma + Social Rating modifier of the armors worn by the participants. If the Social Rating of one participant is 4 or more greater than their opponent, they gain an Edge. The modifiers on the armors are used as written for most Influence-based tests, with the exception of Intimidation. Intimidation tests use the opposite value (i.e. -10 becomes +10) for determining Social Rating.

As usual, all Edge distribution is the realm of the gamemaster, and exceptions can be made for situations where the social disparity of two parties doesn’t really affect their interactions. To avoid too much number-crunching, Social Rating and Defense Rating should not be used in the same situation; basically, once the guns start firing, your appearance is no longer consequential to the way events are unfolding.

# ARES VICTORY LINES

This series has shifted from fashion to faux pas, but that wasn’t really Ares’ fault. And with the nuyen rolling in like it is, they don’t care. The “styles” have basically become armored uniforms for certain trades and market sectors.

## BIG GAME HUNTER

Added to the lineup a few years back, the Big Game Hunter became popular with shadowrunners who cared very little about living in the shadows. The camo patterns were never very urban-friendly, and most wore it because it was the best armor around for its price. Advances have taken some of its edge away, but Ares now has a bestseller with the “tactical black” and “urban camouflage” options that fit much better on the streets. They’re still a little socially maligned, as the bulk and cut aren’t fashion-friendly, but those who buy this line are more likely to shoot first and never ask questions.

## CYCLEWEAR

Seeing the success of designing armor for a group with money to spend and not much sense, Ares threw together a marketing campaign and managed to slap enough different brand tags onto very similar garb to practically corner the market on go-ganger armor. RacerWear, SpeedWear, CycleSafe, and MotoArmor are just four of the two-dozen lines of bike-racing armor Ares has got out there. Every line offers custom logos, light striping, and feedback ’ware among their myriad of features that let the gangs customize to their hearts’ desires while sending all the nuyen to the same place. The popularity of this armor with combat biking and urban brawl fans and teams is also high.

# Vashon Island

The fashion masters at Vashon Island continue to maintain their perch atop the mid-level fashion armor market. A few of their creations are even pushing the limits and brushing elbows with some of the world’s most well-known high-end names.

* The Aces lineup continues to wow with unique designs. The Ace of Spades is a World War II U.S. fighter pilot style. The Ace of Clubs kept the WWII motif but jumped the Atlantic to feature a British bomber pilot style. The Ace of Hearts jumped a century plus forward to a modern military pilot style. The Ace of Diamonds took designs based on the *Spitfire Resurrection* trid series and is looking at making an entire spinoff line after the next installment is released in 2082. The Ace of Cups is a high-collar, floor-length longcoat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half. The Ace of Swords is a WWII Japanese pilot style jacket, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back. The Ace of Wands features some new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents. The Ace of Coins pushes the limits with black juggernaut hide, platinum thread stitching, and solid gold accents.

* The Steampunk line is still going strong with a number of electronic security specialists fitting their new decks into the accoutrements of the suits and dresses. That is usually in addition to the custom link that comes built in (stats on p. 55).

* The Synergist and Actioneer lines are still strong sellers with a touch of priciness, but nothing putting them off the charts in social circles. That was left to the Sleeping Tiger, which came back on the scene just a few years back and now dominates the Vashon Island runways with its color-shifting abilities. Patterns for colors and styles sell for a premium, and several artists are making names for themselves designing one-of-a-kind patterns for wealthy clients (stats on p. 55).

# Accessories and Modifications

## Cumulative

This characteristic means the armor values stack for purposes of determining the Defense Rating. Among armors that do not have this trait, only the highest Defense Rating applies.

## Concealable Ammo Pouch

When a shooter needs somewhere to store and secure their spare ammo clips without advertising that fact, accept no substitutes. Available for pistols, SMGs, carbines, and assault rifles.

The pouches provide a +1 increase to the threshold for the concealability of ammo in the pouch (a typical ammo clip has a Concealability threshold of 4 outside the pouch, 5 inside it). For an additional 100¥, the pouches can be chemically sealed, offering the same bonus (+1) against chemsniffers until the pouch seal is broken to extract the ammo.

## Drag Handle

This cheap but effective accessory makes it easier to pull chummers or other associates out of a hazardous situation, such as gunfire. Typically, a drag handle is attached to the back of an armor system just below the neck and between the shoulders, although it has been known to be attached to the front just below the neckline to facilitate removing an individual from a vehicle.

The drag handle provides a bonus point of Edge to be used for Strength tests to pull a chummer through a hazardous situation.

## Gear Access

This modification makes it easier for the users to access equipment stored within or on their armor, i.e., weapons or ammunition. Not a specific modification, gear access represents several possible modifications to specific accessories such as ammo pouches that easily open, wider mouths of pockets/pouches that make it easier to grab, or methods to help accessories stay in the exact place they are mounted despite rough use.

When pulling gear from armor with gear access, pick up/put down and manual reloading become Minor Actions.

## Hidden Pocket

This is a special little space sewn into the armor that blends in exceptionally well. There’s a limit to a tailor’s magic, but these little spots make great places to tuck away those precious items like credsticks or data chips, or even a hold-out pistol.

The Concealability threshold for items in a hidden pocket increases by 2. Retrieving items from a hidden pocket requires a Major Action.

## Mystic Weave

_(Rating 1-4)_

The key to Parashield’s Mystic Tough armor is this stuff. This add-on accessory can be woven into existing armor to provide a little protection against incoming mojo.

Mystic Weave creates a threshold equal to its rating for all mana-based spells cast on a target but also imposes a negative dice pool modifier on all Magic-related tests equal to double its rating for any magician wearing the armor.

## Programmable Camouflage Package

A simple and cheap modification common to most BDUs, armor clothing, and lighter armors, programmable camo may not be the most effective of concealment options, but it helps the user blend in better with the general surroundings so they don’t stand out too much. Linked to the user’s commlink, a single programmable camo package can hold up to three different patterns/styles. While styles/patterns may vary, the most common are based on environments, such as forest, jungle, desert, arctic, and urban. Custom patterns can also be uploaded.

Environmental patterns offer +1 die to Stealth tests when the appropriate pattern is loaded. If not, the bonus becomes a dice pool penalty.

## Reactive Armor

_(Rating 1-4)_

Reactive armor comes in two forms: plates and GelWeave. Plates are reminiscent of old trauma plate technology. Modern trauma plates are usually high-quality reactive armor plates meant to save a life in the event of a hard center-mass killshot. Plates are stored in special cloth pockets with built-in magnets that allow them to be installed.



---


alongside virtually any personal body armor or even attached to mundane clothing. GelWeave is a custom material used to fabricate armor in various styles that uses a hyper-reactive gel compound to dissipate energy across the armor.

Either form (reactive plates or GelWeave, but not both) can be added to any armor. It reduces incoming DV by its rating, following the rules below.

For plates, this can only be done once and the plate is destroyed and needs to be replaced. Armor can have multiple plates at different ratings but is limited by capacity. The player can choose which plate to use for any incoming attack, and only one plate can be used against a single instance of incoming damage (no combining a bunch of rating 1 plates).

For GelWeave, the armor can resist up to the rating of the GelWeave in incoming damage against each attack. However, the gel becomes rigid when absorbing more than a small hit (1 DV) each round, and reduces Agility, Reaction, and meters of movement by (DV resisted – 1) for three combat turns. These reductions are cumulative across combat rounds, and the duration for all reductions is three rounds after the latest hit. If Reaction or Agility is reduced to 0, the wearer gains the Immobilized status.

## Ruthenium Armor Concealment System

**(Rating 1-4)**

Considered by many to be the apex of tactical concealment technology, the ruthenium armor concealment system (RACS) is an extensive, high-end armor modification that functions as a chameleon suit. Previous iterations had some issues when the user moved, forcing them to remain completely still for effectiveness. While that flaw has been (mostly) corrected with current technologies, the user must be completely covered (meaning all extremities and the head) with ruthenium-modified armor *and* move extremely slowly for the system to work properly. And because it’s extremely effective, the RACS is considered mil-spec technology and therefore is extremely regulated; simply owning it without the proper credentials is considered a felony in most nations. This system includes a head piece that provides no armor benefit, but a helmet purchased (for the basic helmet price of 200 nuyen) along with the system can be integrated into the entire package.

This system offers a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests and creates a threshold equal to its rating for the opposition’s Perception test to detect the wearer. This threshold drops by one for every meter past three the user moves during a combat round. During combat, the system raises the wearer’s Defense Rating by 2 due to the shifting patterns.

## Shockweave

**(Rating 2-6)**

This modification can be a rather nasty surprise for someone who tries to go hands-on without permission. Special conductive filaments line the armor and are attached to a high-discharge battery pack. When the unwanted subject makes contact that exceeds a certain force (delivering at least DV 2 before the Body resistance roll), they receive an electrical shock (DV (Rating)S(e)). The battery can deliver four shocks before needing to recharge. To prevent friendlies from being affected, the shockweave system has a basic IFFB (identification friend/foe biometrics) system.

Treat IFFB system as Safe Firing IFF System (p. 62) targeting system.

## Thermal Dissipation

**(Rating 1-2)**

Special fibers combined with new breathable materials allow the user to fight or stave off the effects of heat in hot and/or humid climates such as the desert and jungle. While it doesn’t help against fire damage, it’s handy when you’re spending long periods in the field.

Each rank of thermal dissipation eliminates one level of being fatigued due to overheating or grants +1 resistance versus heat damage.

## Toughweave

**(Rating 1-3)**

A new armor modification that went into service only six months ago courtesy of YNT (an Evo subsidiary), Toughweave reportedly has the potential to be a game-changer in armor technology.

Exact specs are still highly classified, but this new modification is slowly being integrated into Evo corpsec forces for field testing. Not much is known about this highly secretive modification. What little YNT has revealed in limited press releases states that “The new Toughweave™ armor protection system not only offers maximum protection against all known forms of penetrative damage, but also effectively dissipates most kinetic damage as well.” So far YNT has been stingy with its supply of Toughweave, preferring to keep it in-house for now. But rumors are starting to spread about the necessary materials making it into certain black markets in Central America, South America, and East Asia.

Each level of Toughweave provides –1 to DV on every incoming attack but imposes the wild die on all damage resistance tests.

# CUSTOMIZING WEAPONS

> Some say a warrior is only as good as their weapon, others say the warrior makes the weapon. Others say the warrior is the weapon. But whatever philosophy you ascribe to, a weapon should be an extension of the warrior, a part of their being and as familiar to them as their shoes, because in the heat of combat, your weapon may literally be the difference between life and death. Problem is that (most) weapons are mass-produced products and are not one-size-fits-all. That’s where customization through modifications and accessories comes in. The idea is to customize a weapon to the user’s exact specs and needs while maximizing its utility and lethality in their hands. Like in the **Weapons Rack** file, below is a list of the current popular weapon mods and accessories. But also remember one thing: No matter how good your weapon may be or how many SOTA mods and accessories it may have, a weapon is worthless unless the warrior has the skills to use it properly.  
> Rifleman

## WEAPON MODIFICATIONS

### ACCESSORY RAILS

Current firearm industry standards call for most weapons to feature at least two integral accessory rails or mounts as standard. These usually are located over or under the barrel. For many shooters and professionals, however, this simply isn’t enough. Typically attached to the firearm’s sides, accessory rails enable shooters to add two more accessories than what the weapon could normally mount. These mounts may vary in exact size depending on the weapon, but one rail accepts one accessory. Pistols are unable to accept accessory rails on the sides because they interfere with the weapon’s operation.

# RULES FOR WEAPON CUSTOMIZATION

There are two ways to customize a weapon in *SR6*: with accessories and with modifications.

Accessories are items that are attached externally to a weapon (usually a firearm). These can easily be added to or removed from the weapon in question without a skill check. Switching accessories during combat is a Major Action. Each weapon type comes with a specific number of accessory slot locations available per *SR6* core rules (see weapon category descriptions, pp. 251-257, *SR6*). Each slot can hold one accessory. If an accessory is damaged or rendered inoperable by whatever means, the weapon continues to function without the accessory bonuses.

A modification means mechanically altering a weapon in order to enhance its performance or gain a bonus. Modifying a weapon requires an Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended test. Once the modification is made, it cannot be removed without another Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended test. A glitch on any modification test concerning any internal components means that the attempt was unsuccessful and the weapon cannot function until the modification is completed or removed with an Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (6, 1 hour) Extended test.  
A critical glitch means not only that the modification was unsuccessful, but also that the weapon was damaged in the attempt and will need to be repaired with an Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (10, 1 hour) Extended test before functionality is restored.

As with accessories, each weapon type has a specific number of capacity slots available for modifications (unless stated otherwise in an individual weapon’s description) based on the weapon type. When weapons have a modification as a standard item, those modifications do not take away one of the weapon’s modification slots. Modifications typically use a single slot; the rules for each item note if they take more. The number of modifications cannot exceed the number of available slots, and some modifications cannot be used in conjunction with each other; see individual descriptions for details.

If a weapon does not have an AR at a particular range, a modification or accessory cannot increase that rating unless specifically noted.

----

## BARREL EXTENSION

Slapping a few extra inches on the end of a barrel makes a world of difference when you’re putting hot lead way down range. It even helps when trying to do mid-range work with a short-range arm. Problem is, it makes it harder to tuck and run, and you start finding that when the barrel clears a corner first, lead often finds its way to you before you get a chance to fire some of your own.

> *I like putting the extra on machine pistols, giving them a little more versatility while still being able to get tucked like an SMG.*  
> — Mika

> *Why not just use an SMG? Anyway, I was going to mention slapping this on a long-range weapon doesn’t really help a ton, but it still helps a little.*  
> — Ma’Fan

**Note:** The barrel extension mod moves the concealability threshold of a weapon down one, adds an available AR range category that starts at 0, and modifies the AR as follows:  
$$-2 / — / +1 / +2 / +2$$  
If a weapon has no Attack Rating in a given range category before this modification is applied, that category is not affected.

----

## BIOMETRIC GUN LOCK

On the list of things that absolutely suck during a firefight, having your weapon taken from and then used against you is near the top. Biometric locks (usually) prevent this by locking the weapon in a “safe” mode, rendering it inert if anyone other than the weapon’s primary (or other authorized) user attempts to use it. Installed in the weapon’s grip, biometric locks are programmed to read biometric profiles that are programmed into and then stored in a standard or weapon commlink to remotely activate/deactivate the weapon as needed. Additional profiles can be programmed so that friendlies can use the weapon in emergencies. And for additional fun, the biometric lock can also be linked to a weapon security system to trigger whatever security measures are installed.

----

## OF SMARTGUN SYSTEMS AND WEAPON SLOTS

While the internal smartgun system is listed as an accessory in *SR6* (p. 261), it’s treated as a modification for capacity purposes. This means that an internal smartgun system included as standard equipment does not take away any weapon modification slots. For the specific number of modification capacity slots available to various weapons, refer to the list below.

**NUMBER OF WEAPON MODIFICATION SLOTS BY TYPE**

- **Blades and Clubs:** 2  
- **Tasers:** 2  
- **Pistols** (light, heavy, machine): 3*  
- **SMGs:** 4  
- **Machine Guns** (light, medium, heavy): 4  
- **Shotguns:** 5  
- **Sniper Rifles:** 5  
- **Assault Rifles:** 6  

\*Hold-out pistols cannot accept any modifications or accessories.

> Be warned: The electronic system can be made wireless, which means it’s hackable—which in turn means someone could get in and erase all stored biometric profiles, making the weapon unusable.

## COLLAPSIBLE STOCK

Classic and simple versatility. Going long, slide it out. In close, tuck it tight. Bulked up in armor, set it for comfort. It may be simple, but it provides options.

**Wireless:** Changing the setting does not require an action.  
**Note:** The collapsible stock operates on two basic settings (full and tucked), which can be swapped with a Minor Action. On full, the collapsible stock alters AR as follows: –2/—/+1/+2/+1. On tucked, it alters AR as follows: +1/+1/—/–2/–2 and increases the concealability threshold by 1. If a weapon has no Attack Rating in a given range category before this modification is applied, that category is not affected.

## CUSTOM STYLE

We all know most weapons carry an inherent level of social threat, but with the right touches, colors, and accents an instrument of death can easily become a work of art—while remaining deadly. The direction and purpose of that artistic flair can easily translate into a bit of social nudging. Which direction the nudge goes is all based on the user’s desires. Plate it in gold to show your flashy side, matte black and some red highlights for some intimidation, or covered in expensive filigree to show your peers how elegant lethality can be, or a nice patriotic jade green and white to show your status within MCT.

> * I’ve always thought big revolvers were all designed to look scary until I met a woman I’ll call Jane. She had the barrel of her Ruger Warhawk thickened, and the last inch was bored out just a little extra. Looking down the barrel up close you swore you were looking into a train tunnel. Unnerved many a ganger on the streets of Dallas-Fort Worth.

When presenting the weapon, whether for display or attack, the character gains a bonus Edge for the associated Social test (but not for any other tests).

----

# DIKOTE

Through a process that deposits a thin diamond coat on a sharp surface such as a blade or arrowhead, the cutting and edge-retention abilities of an item can be enhanced. The process to apply dikote involves brief exposure of the base material to a plasma furnace, which limits the process to sufficiently durable materials like steel and ceramic.

# EASY BREAKDOWN

Being able to get that pistol, SMG, sniper rifle, or whatever down to its component bits is great when making a quick getaway or attempting to sneak it through scanners. Most sec forces are trained to recognize weapon parts, but it’s better than nothing. Bigger arms often come with a case for a little extra (250 nuyen), and for the smaller ones you can usually find something to disguise it as.

* Any urban operator can use this. Sniper on a roof walks out in a suit with a briefcase. High-security meet with Mr. Johnson goes south because he’s a dirtbag, and you’ll be glad you dropped the parts of your Predator into your pockets and fanny pack.

**Wireless:** AR guides help break down larger arms in a single Major Action and smaller arms in a single Minor Action.  
**Note:** It takes two Major Actions to break down SMGs and larger weapons into their components for storage or stealth purposes, and one to break down pistols. When a weapon is broken into component form, increase its concealability threshold by 2. The assembly process takes the same amount of time.

----

# FOLDING STOCK

A simple after-market modification for SMGs, shotguns, and rifles, folding stocks are often used to make the weapon more portable and concealable when not in use and provide some stability while firing. When in use, they simply fold out and act like a normal stock would. After-market folding stocks tend to be a bit weaker structurally, as well as uncomfortable. They also don’t absorb as much recoil if the weapon is being used for full-auto fire or long-range shooting.  
Folding and unfolding the stock is a Minor Action.

**Note:** If attached to a weapon, apply the following to the Attack Rating adjustments, remembering that Attack Ratings cannot go below zero: —/—/–1/–2/–3. Also, add +1 to the threshold of a Perception test for anyone attempting to spot this weapon when it is concealed.

----

# FOREGRIP

The simple installation of a grip along the barrel is such a game-changer across so many aspects of modern warfare. Sweeps and turns are quicker, grip and control are stronger, and recoil is easier to keep in check. A simple tool with so many versatile supports.

> No one else commented here. This is a pretty plain accessory, but why no love? I’ll say just about every real operator I know owns at least one AR with this, and most militaries around the world have them added to every weapon they order. It’s that useful. This also makes them cheap and disposable, and as such a great place to hide small items and toss them aside for retrieval later. Outside-the-box stuff.

Attack Rating reductions for Semi Auto, Burst Fire, and Full Auto change to 1, 3, and 4 respectively. Cannot be combined with a silencer or suppressor.

## GECKO GRIP

The material has been great for climbing for decades and making stuff stick to other stuff really well. Deciding to take a layer and apply it to the grip of a weapon to make sure it stays in your hand is a genius move. The gecko grip isn’t just about holding on—it can also be programmed to stick the weapon to a surface or a person for storage or sneaking.

> * We’ve got a rapid-response team that uses the roof of the rig to hold an assortment of arms and equipment with this stuff. They can pull whatever they need straight off the roof. Handy for making sure everything gets back as well. And when they need to free up their hands they can just stick the gear to themselves.

**Wireless:** Activation or deactivation commands can be issued to multiple devices. Activating or deactivating provides a bonus Minor Action.  
**Note:** Gecko grip provides a bonus Edge that can only be used on tests to maintain a grip on a weapon. Activating or deactivating the sticking features requires a Minor Action.

## GYRO MOUNT II

Base models can always be upgraded, and the advancements made to improve the basic gyro mount are SOTA. Micro-articulate stabilization, nano-responsive energy absorption protocols, and wireless-commanded mounts make this the slickest recoil-absorbing articulated firing platform on the market.

They were all running wide open and obviously cared frag-all, because in the span of a few seconds we were dodging full-auto fire from the four and dipping off the tracking of four incoming missiles.

**Wireless:** Exiting the harness using wireless quick-release is a Minor Action. The weapon’s augmented reality firing control system can be used to free up the firer’s hands to perform other actions while the weapon is firing. This includes making an attack with another weapon if a Major Action is available.  
**Note:** The gyro mount II negates the SA and BF modifiers to Attack Rating by 1 and reduces FA modifier to 2. This system also shifts the Strength requirements for medium and heavy machine guns to 2+ and 3+ respectively. While wearing the harness, characters lower both Agility and Reaction by 1. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Minor Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about a minute, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Major Action.

## HEAVYWEIGHT

Nice thing about a gun with some girth is that it never comes far off the target when you pull the trigger. It also gives you some real buff arms shooting that thing all day, but then again, if you know what you’re doing, you never have to shoot for that long.

# Melee Hardening

Sometimes in combat, you run out of options and have no other choice than to clobber a fragger with your firearm. And most modern firearms aren’t exactly meant to take that kind of punishment without risking damage to the internal electronics or breaking the weapon itself. Or maybe you just like having a gun that doubles as a club. In either case, you’d better modify your weapon with melee hardening. Accomplished through a metallurgic enhancing process called Chemo-Forge™, this treatment structurally enhances the outside and internals, increasing the firearm’s structural strength by approximately 150 percent. The process works just as advertised, but there’s a drawback. The process permeates the weapon, and while the manufacturer claims the process has no side effects on maintenance or performance, multiple field reports say that after the melee hardening process, firearms are said to feel a bit “sticky.”

> * Agreed. I swear to Ghost that every melee hardened weapon I’ve touched feels like it’s still got something on it. Not enough to cause any real issues, but annoying.  
> * Sounder  
> * That’s because they basically drown the gun in that Chemo-Forge goop during the hardening process. And no matter how much you clean it, it won’t come off because the chemicals bond to the gun at the molecular level. And some also claim that breakdown is noticeably harder.

* I guess I can accept this level of tech out of Evo after my last trip to Pretoria. The place is starting to look like those “city of the future” trids they used to show us as a kid. Flying cars, skyrakers touching the clouds, and arcologies filling the depths centuries of mining had cleared. Making a high-tech stock seems mundane by comparison.

# Rigid Stock

A solid mass at the back of a solid weapon can make all the difference in getting the right shot. It feels steady and strong tucked in tight and even slips under your armpit more comfortably than one of those thin pieces of plastic or polycarbonate.

# Safe Firing IFF System

News flash: Combat is chaotic. And with the advent of modern tech and the inclusion of magical effects onto the battlefield, it’s only gotten worse. The middle of this chaos is where you get casualties from friendly fire. To help prevent this, the Safe Firing IFF (identification friend/foe) System was developed. Designed to work in conjunction with the basic smartgun system, commlinks, and other sensor platforms, current Safe Firing Systems employ a combination of built-in, multiple, redundant detection/identification methods (including RFID tags, biometrics, and body/facial recognition software) to identify friendlies in combat. When active, the Safe System uses these methods to create an “ID profile” which helps prevent a weapon from firing at someone who has been identified as a friendly. For the system to work, it must be used in conjunction with a smartgun system. The current Safe Firing System can be programed with up

# SIDE AMMO MOUNT

It cannot be said enough: there’s no such thing as having too much ammo during a prolonged battle. But there’re also times when it’s not the amount of ammo you have, but the type. It’s not uncommon to find some fragger who has some kind of specialty armor or protection that requires a quick ammo changeup. Or mission parameters may change and require going from less-than-lethal to lethal ammo, or vice versa. Side ammo mounts allow shooters to have extra clips or shotgun shells ready for when the change is required without having to use an ammo pouch. Typically mounted on the weapon’s side opposite the ejection port, the side ammo mount can hold one clip or five shotgun shells. Handy for keeping an extra clip or shells on hand, ammo mounts make the weapon bulkier and harder to conceal. Additionally, side mounts are incompatible with the use of any detachable drum magazines.

> Shotgun aficionados especially like the side mounts. Just pop the ejection port open and you can tactically reload with whatever shell you want.  
> Hard Exit  
> Same thing for long-gunners with spare clips; especially when you’re prone and reaching for a new clip isn’t feasible. Only downside with this versus a shotgun is that you have to plan ahead when loading the spare clip.

# STOCK

It may seem obvious, but sometimes just throwing something as simple as a stock on a weapon can offer stability. This isn’t anything more special than a piece of regular composite (or wood, if you’re rich) that is mounted on the back of the weapon. You can even toss them on pistols, though you still don’t get much benefit in the way of range.

* Also makes a great object to smack someone with if you run out of bullets. Not the best club in the world, but better than bending your barrel trying to pistol-whip someone.

# TRIGGER REMOVAL

A popular weapon modification for shooters who (for whatever reason) have difficulty manipulating a standard trigger, the trigger removal modification replaces the normal mechanisms with a remote trigger assembly. This assembly is linked directly to a smartgun system and allows the user to fire and otherwise operate the weapon with a mental or pre-programmed verbal/audio command. The major downside to this modification is that if wireless connectivity is lost, then all a shooter has is a hunk of metal and plastics.

# UNDERBARREL WEAPON MOUNT AND ATTACHMENTS

In combat, you need any edge you can get, and that sometimes means adding even more bang to your bang-bang. Underbarrel weapons first gained prominence in the late 1960s when grenade launchers were attached under the barrels of what we today consider assault rifles. And it wasn’t long until other weapons were being attached. The underbarrel weapon attachment mount allows for multiple purpose-built weapon-types (each sold separately!) to be attached and integrated into the host weapon system. While this allows for some interesting combinations, using an underbarrel weapon that’s not integrally designed into the host weapon makes it extremely bulky, so good luck trying to hide it. The current popular weapons to attach include: a small shotgun, a micro-grenade launcher, a micro combat chainsaw, bolo launcher, and grapple hook launcher.

* Note about the grapple hook: It’s a launcher only in that it fires the hook; it doesn’t provide the rest of the climbing gear. And you better attach the line to a winch, harness, or at least a belt because <takes deep breath> **a weapon will not support your fat hoop!**
* Mika
* The micro-bolo launcher is pretty wiz. The balls are fired by compressed air tanks and feature special air-flow channels that allow them to fly better and still have enough weight to wrap the titanium-mesh wire around the target. Great for capture jobs, but you’ll need to get in nice and close. Launcher only holds two shots at a time but has enough air for ten shots before recharge is needed.
* Stone

# UNDERBARREL WEIGHT / HEAVY BARREL

One way or the other, you can tweak your street howitzer to ignore that desire to rise upward after every shot by making the barrel too much to throw. It does a great job of bulking up your forearms on pistols and makes a great shoulder workout for the rest, but slinging lead downrange in rapid succession is a lot easier when the barrel doesn’t keep bucking off target.

# Weapon Security System

There are many times on or off the battlefield when someone will try to take your weapon from you. Maybe they’ve pulled off some wiz martial arts move or a lucky shot and disarmed you. Or maybe they’ve broken into your storage locker for a snatch and grab. Or maybe, they’re taking it from your cold dead hands. To prevent the weapon from being used against you (or as a final “frag you” if you’re geeked), some shooters install a weapon security system (WSS). A WSS has three components: a basic recognition system, a linked biometric lock, and the anti-theft countermeasure. Linked to a smartgun system and/or a weapon commlink, the WSS triggers the anti-theft countermeasure if anyone other than an authorized user attempts to use the weapon. These countermeasures come in three varieties with different levels of severity: spring-loaded AP spikes, taser shock, or explosives. RFID trackers are also available for weapon location and recovery.

Anti-personnel spikes are loaded into the weapon’s handle and deploy into the target’s hand to cause pain and injury. The taser-shock option is also located in the handle and hits the target with an electric attack. The explosive countermeasure is located internally and comes with two settings—one simply bricks the weapon if activated, while the other turns the weapon into an HE grenade. The RFID tracker is just that, a hidden beacon that can be set to broadcast if an unauthorized user attempts to use the weapon or if the weapon travels a specific distance from the primary user. While handy, a WSS’s popularity is somewhat mixed. Some shooters like the security and final retaliation option they often provide, while others see them as more of a liability in the heat of combat.

* During the Az-Am War, Aztlan mercs would “lose” weapons with WSS installed and designed to activate the first time they were gripped. Lots of curious civilians or those who just wanted to get rid of them lost body parts or their lives.  
* Picador  
* Don’t think these are just for firearms—most biometric readers and security systems can also be installed in melee weapons. An adept took my combat sword from me and regretted it for the rest of his life. All five seconds of it.

# Weapon Commlink

With commlinks being a vital part of life in the Sixth World, it was inevitable that someone would put a commlink into a weapon. And then try to figure out why they wanted to do that. The first weapon commlinks debuted in 2074 and were designed to act as a sort of personal aid for the shooter as well as perform many of the commlink’s standard functions. They did not, however, really catch on with professionals, who saw them as superfluous and often unnecessary. But with the ever-advancing threat of modern electronic and cyber-warfare, weapon commlinks found a new lease on life. In 2078, Renraku started producing (with other corps and companies quickly following suit) their version of the

----

WEAPON MODIFICATIONS // CUSTOMIZING WEAPONS

weapon commlink, which acts as a dedicated internal communication suite, as well as an additional line of defense against electronic attack. A weapon commlink is basically a micro-command and control router for a user’s PAN. It collects and routes all data from broadcasting weapons/gear and encrypts the data making it more difficult to hack. It also provides a firewall that is accumulative when linked with other devices, PANs, or tactical networks. And because the data is routed through the commlink, the weapon commlink will take damage before the weapon itself does, acting s a sort of cyber-circuit breaker. Most electronics will still be shot, but at least the weapon will still go bang when the trigger is pulled. The main drawback to the weapon commlink continues to be how much internal capacity it takes up and the overall cost.

> This is something that one would, or in my opinion should, put on their most valuable or primary weapon. I have one installed in a rather expensive sniper rifle—I’d sooner lose an arm (again) than risk that one.

**Note:** Activating the flashing blade requires two Minor Actions. A designated opponent receives the Blinded II status (p. 51, SR6) on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. If the target has low-light vision, the status increases to Blinded III. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The Flashing Blade has five charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it regains one charge every ten seconds.

## SCRAPBUILT

Kludging together weapons out of scrap metal is an old barrens tradition. Up-and-coming gang members are often short on nuyen, so they learn to make do with scraps of sharpened car parts or plumbing.

# WEAPON ACCESSORIES

The following accessories can be mounted to weapons. Each accessory lists the mount to which it is attached per the rules on p. 259, *SR6*; some accessories do not take up a slot, and for others you can choose between the listed slots.

## ARES GUNFIGHTER SCABBARD

The Gunfighter Scabbard has been a staple among Ares Corporate Military Forces (ACMF) for almost two decades. It was originally available only to Firewatch teams and later to the ACMF or select clients, but in the past few months, Ares has made the Gunfighter available on the open market in limited numbers. Designed as a scabbard for larger firearms such as a shotgun or rifle (but also works just as well with larger bladed weapons) that’s typically worn on the back, the Gunfighter is designed to provide the user with additional storage and ease of access while in the field. The Gunfighter accomplishes this through the use of memory materials that are pre-programmed with “weapon molds” to (mostly) enclose and secure a specific weapon. Past models only had the capability to be programmed for a single weapon, but recent Gunfighter models can be programmed with up to three different, specific weapon molds. The scabbard uses a proximity RFID sensor that is attached to the weapon in question, and old-fashioned pressure/leverage to know when to release or secure a weapon. Note that this system must be wirelessly active and able to communicate with the user’s commlink in order to function properly. If this system is compromised or signal is otherwise lost, the Gunfighter defaults and remains in whatever mode it was previously in. In case of emergencies, it features a manual override switch that releases a secured weapon—just don’t expect to be able to put the weapon back until normal functionality is restored. The one major drawback of the Gunfighter is that the memory materials take at least two seconds to release, so don’t count on quick drawing with this.

> So can I use this thing for, say, pistols or an SMG?  
> X-Prime  
> You can, but it would be overkill and a waste of a mold in my opinion. No, this is best used for the aforementioned larger weapons like combat shotguns, assault rifles, or maybe an EBR. And it’s also worth mentioning that the Gunfighter doesn’t completely encompass the weapon. Barrels, clips, stocks, grips, or any other external accessory are often left exposed, which means they can become snagged or smack up against things if the user isn’t careful.  
> Picador  
> That goes double for any kind of sniper rifle, no matter how compact it may be. Barrel attachments such as suppressors or larger specialized optics are especially prone to this. And for the love of whatever deity you worship, don’t try to use a Gunfighter to carry a large sniper or anti-materiel rifle. It doesn’t work well, and you look stupid.  
> Balladeer  
> I like the fact that even though it’s called a Gunfighter, I can carry my larger bladed weapons such as my trusty battle axe.

Re-programming a weapon mold requires either a Software + Logic or Engineering (Armorer) + Logic (3, 1 hour) test.  
**Slot:** None

## AMMO POUCH (REGULAR)

This simple and inexpensive accessory is often forgotten about yet is nonetheless essential for the modern gunfighter. Regular ammo pouches are *not* designed for use on a MEMS. Typically looped onto a belt or sling, they provide easy access to and retention for loaded firearm clips up to assault rifles. Ammo pouches typically come with either a securable flap that goes over the clip, or are open-ended with a friction-retention system built in. Each pouch carries one clip that’s based


---


on the firearm type. Ammo pouches specifically for shotgun rounds are also available; these hold eight standard shells in external loops for the same kind of easy access. Ammo pouches can also be attached to other pouches and then attached to belts, slings, or directly to armor systems (excluding MEMS, which has its own pouches).

> It still makes me shake my head when wannabe runners try keeping their extra clips in pockets. Many a rookie has gotten themselves killed because they wasted precious seconds fishing a clip out of their synth-denim jeans or armored jacket.  
> Danger Sensei

> Or worse, they start clanking together or fall out of said pocket. Last week, both happened to a last-second replacement on my team. Fragger gave away our position and lost a full clip of APDS. After we finished the job, we told our fixer to lose his comm number.

### Ammo Sling

Sometimes the simple things work the best. The ammo sling is basically an inexpensive synth-leather or synth-nylon bandolier with micro-hardpoints that allow ammo pouches to be attached. The idea is for a shooter (or some poor non-combatant) to carry extra ammo for when the shooting goes beyond expectations, but the individual isn’t wearing tactical armor. Ammo slings can also be attached to a weapon—they’re extremely popular with shotgunners—or simply worn on the waist or over the shoulder. For an additional fifteen nuyen, the sling includes a tactical gear pouch for when you need to store your non-bang-bang stuff or even more clips.

> Okay, this seems kind of useless. Why waste my time with it?  
> X-Prime

> You haven’t learned a fragging thing running with me, have you? More ammo is always good, but with those micro-hardpoints, you can also attach grenades for easy access. And that pouch is a great place to keep some C-12 handy. And it makes a good impromptu satchel charge.

### Armored Retention Holster

A staple among law-enforcement and security providers to help keep their primary duty sidearm secure, the armored retention holster (ARH) provides the user with two benefits: keeping the sidearm in question out of someone else’s hands and providing the weapon with an extra bit of protection from stray (or targeted) weapons fire. Coming in a variety of styles and fitted to the specific weapon, the ARH is only available for holdout, light, or heavy pistols and features either a manual or wireless retention release; the latter requiring a biometric reader. An ARH is designed for function first, with concealability coming in a distant second. That means they tend to be a bit bulkier than standard holsters and are typically used for open carry.

> An ARH isn’t infallible and can be overcome. But once you try, unless you’re really fragging good, you just blew your cover and your target knows exactly where you are. And they normally don’t like having their weapons pilfered.  
> Mika

> I also like ARHs because they keep your pistols secure when you have to go hands-on or to the ground, because opponents *love* to take your stuff from you, usually to use against you.

### Bayonet

Some consider the bayonet an archaic piece of military hardware. Others won’t go into combat without one. A bayonet is a blade that attaches to a rifle, usually over or under the barrel, to be used when combat gets up-close and personal. Modern bayonets typically come in two flavors: fixed or retractable. Retractable bayonets are typically a triangular-shaped spike that can be controlled through a smartgun system, manually deployed, or programmed for voice command. Fixed models

## CONCEALABLE QUICK DRAW HOLSTER

Having quick access to a well-hidden weapon is the best of both worlds. With a mix of smart materials and precision body measurements, these holsters can fit a pistol of any size and keep it in a spot with fast access. It’s usually the small of the back, along the midriff, or against a limb and usually built with clothing in mind. Each holster is, of course, specific to its weapon.

> These are a must-have for any runner. Keeping a weapon on you at all times is pretty much part of the job, and this is the best way to haul one around without everyone always giving you the side-eye. I personally like to keep two tucked in close just in case one gets spotted.

## DETACHABLE DRUM MAGAZINE

In any gun battle, there’s no such thing as having too much ammo. The detachable drum magazine (DDM) is available for any clip-fed firearm except for hold-out pistols and MGs. DDMs of-

**CUSTOMIZING WEAPONS // WEAPON ACCESSORIES**

fer a shooter the chance to carry additional ammunition in the weapon itself without necessarily having to carry as many extra clips. Sizes and shapes vary and are based on the class of weapon it’s being used in. On average, a DDM doubles the weapon’s ammunition capacity. This extra capacity comes with a few costs. First, attaching a DDM all but negates any chance of concealment, especially for any pistol type. Second, because of their size and shape, DDMs are difficult to conceal; there are no ammo pouches on the market that can accommodate them. A drum holster-clip is available for an additional 25 nuyen; this holster-clip can attach to any belt, waistband, or MEMS unit. And third, DDMs are known for being difficult to load ammunition into, which is not something recommended during combat.

> My style is to use a standard clip when I need to conceal, but keep a couple extended ones handy when the first runs dry. Logic being that if I have to burn through the first one, I’m likely in a situation where I’m going to need the extra ammo.  
> Cayman

> Also use some common sense when using extended clips. They’re fine for an SMG or assault rifle, for example, but completely improper for an EBR or sniper rifle while shooting prone.  
> Balladeer

> I often use a DDM or extended clip in my primary weapon and then switch to standard clips when it runs dry. Allows me to maintain my stealth profile and take advantage of the extra ammo capacity.  
> Rifleman

## EXTENDED CLIP

Extended clips are meant to be the balance between having extra ammo on hand and not completely blowing your stealth profile by using drum mags—although larger extended clips stand out just as much as drum magazines, if not more so. Extended clips come in two styles: rating 1 and rating 2. Rating 1 extended clips offer a five-round increase in ammo capacity, while rating 2 clips offer a ten-round increase. But like with any non-standard weapon clip, extended clips are more difficult to conceal, especially when loaded into a holstered weapon.

## FLASHLIGHT, LOW-LIGHT

Even a small flashlight can be downright blinding when operating with low-light systems, so the engineering geniuses of the world designed this little baby. It looks like a regular flashlight, but the light it puts out registers and reflects far better with low-light-perceiving systems, whether they be biological or technological in nature. Those with low-light vision get a substantial improvement to their viewing, but those with unenhanced eyeballs see, at most, a dull purple glow.

> I hate these things. Mainly because they push the advantage way over to the side of those with augmentations or natural low-light. Frag if I will ever run a night op near the Tír again.

# Guncam

Part targeting and imaging system, guncams fill a special niche in a shooter’s arsenal. Originally designed as a monitoring and training tool, early guncams were almost phased out in favor of more advanced systems like the now-standard image link. But they remained popular within the shooting world as a training tool and were handy for calibrating weapons. Used in conjunction with the smartlink/smartgun system or other targeting systems, guncams use custom software to track a bullet or projectile’s (this includes arrows/bolts, launched grenades, or rockets) actual trajectory in real time. When overlaid with smartgun data, guncams assist with follow-up shots when you miss or help map out full-auto fire patterns without having to use tracers. And if you just need a good camera to help assess the situation, guncams can also mount a limited number of visual enhancements.

# Hip Pad Bracing System

We’ve seen it in the trids. Hold the gun low and spray and pray, but somehow this inaccurate mess wipes out everyone in the room. Oh, unless it’s the bad guys, and then the spray and pray misses everything.

You still lose accuracy at a distance but that is not what this is designed for.

# MACHINE GUN "BLAST SHIELDS"

Another low-tech accessory that’s popular with machine gunners is the simple and effective blast shield. In a nutshell, blast shields are armor plates attached to the side of a machine gun in order to give the shooter additional protection. Exact dimensions and specs may vary, but blast shields typically come in two sizes: the smaller 30 x 60 centimeter plate for use on portable MGs, or the larger 60 x 120 centimeter plates use on fixed (or semi-fixed) positions. Blast shields also come in a variety of configurations and styles, but all are made from heavy anti-ballistic materials combined with some kind of additional deflective properties. This means they’re simply angled in some way to deflect incoming fire, or they feature additional bits of armor attached to accomplish the same. And while extra protection is always a plus, blast shields are bulky and heavy, especially the larger ones. Even those made with modern lightweight materials will slow a machine gunner down if they try to maneuver too much while using them.

# RANGER ARMS "EAGLE EYE" TARGETING SENSOR SUITE

Introduced by Ranger Arms in 2077, the Eagle Eye is a compact sensor suite that can be linked with a weapon’s smartgun system or imaging scope. Originally designed for long-range shooting, the Eagle Eye features a laser rangefinder, micro-doppler radar system, and ultrasound sensor that work in conjunction to provide (as the advertisements claim) “the clearest sight and target picture ever, no matter the environment.” While the Eagle Eye performs admirably at long range, it performs extremely poorly when used in any other fashion, especially when the shooter is moving or multiple rounds are fired in succession (read: burst or full auto mode).

> My unit was approached by Ranger Arms to field-test the Eagle Eye, but I never let it get that far. During training exercises, shot groups at long range were some of the tightest I’ve ever seen. But when we put some on an assault rifle to see what would happen, we couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn past short ranges—we had better luck with iron sights. The Eagle-Eye’s targeting and calculating software can’t collate the data from the three systems fast enough to keep up with fire and maneuver tactics. So keep it on the long guns.

**Note:** When attached, changes an applicable weapon’s AR by –4/–5/–4/+3/+2. For sensors to function properly, shooter must remain immobile and cannot take any other actions except Take Aim and firing the weapon.

## REGULAR AND TACTICAL SLING

A firearm is no good if you can’t aim and shoot it before your opponent does. And constantly carrying your primary weapon in an up-and-ready position (especially on long missions) can get tiring really fragging fast. Tactical slings help shooters keep and SMG, shotgun, or assault rifle in the low-ready position while lessening arm fatigue, and retain the weapon even when they have do things like going for another weapon or striking some fragger in the face. Tactical slings attach to the stock of the weapon and are made of a tough Kevlar-nylon weave that has a decent amount of stretchability. They go over the shoulder or attach directly to a MEMS harness. Regular slings are made of the same materials but are attached to points at the front and back of the weapon. They are basically for carrying weapons over the shoulder; they don’t provide any advantages in bringing the weapon to bear in a fight. Ammo pouches are often attached to regular slings for extra ammo capacity.

> Tough is right. I’ve seen troopers pulled out of the line of fire by nothing but their tactical slings, and one case where someone was kept from falling out of a t-bird when her teammates grabbed her rifle.

## RUTHENIUM RIFLE SHEATH

Ruthenium in the wrong hands leads to some stupid stuff, but sometimes you find something for which it was perfectly suited. The sheath is a thin photovoltaic layer of ruthenium that covers every square centimeter of a weapon. The weapon essentially disappears into the background or blends with the surroundings. Even melee weapons can have this, but repeated impacts or any blood that gets on them damages the effect.

> Be sure not to drop it while the ruthenium is active unless you have the wireless up, which often negates the point of having this stuff in the first place. My advice: Don’t set the weapon down or lose your grip on it.

This mod increases the Concealability threshold of the weapon by 1 level when trying to hide it from visual inspection. When used in conjunction with a ruthenium suit, it blends the gun right into the suit. When used with a melee weapon, the first attack made with the weapon gains a +4 to Attack Rating. After this attack, a Major Action is required to clean the weapon or reset the system.  
A dropped weapon without wireless active has a Concealability threshold of at least 4, or +1 for all concealability ratings of 4 or greater.

# HONING YOUR EDGE

> Last time we did a combat file update, I left some data-space open to talk about principles, tactics, and other tips we can employ in the shadows.

## Opening Thoughts: Musings of a Mercenary  
*Posted by: Rifleman*

Let’s get some of my personal ramblings out of the way first.  
In this biz, combat is unavoidable. Accept this now instead of being surprised later when something goes sideways. You’re going to have to put foot to hoop or paint a wall with someone’s brains, because they’ll be trying to do the same to you.  
You won’t win every fight, so learn to recognize that outcome before you get rocked.  
It doesn’t matter if you’re in a shootout, slinging mojo, or trading blows in a back-alley beatdown; combat encounters are won by whoever has enough grey matter to read the situation and act/react accordingly.  
Surviving always counts as a win.  
People will die around you, including teammates. Make peace with that.  
The time for freaking is after combat, not during.  
Combat isn’t about fairness. It’s about winning, and the prize is your life and the lives of your compatriots.  
When life is on the line, cheaters do, in fact, prosper. Use every advantage you’ve got, because your adversary will do the same.  
If you don’t have any advantages, someone fragged up.

----

**OPENING THOUGHTS: MUSINGS OF A MERCENARY // HONING YOUR EDGE**


---


There’s a time for honor in combat. It occurs before and after someone is actively trying to kill you. In between, all bets are off.  
Don’t hesitate to act; hesitation gives your opponents an opportunity, which may be all they need.  
Never plan on your enemy being stupid, but take full advantage if they are.  
Never squander luck.  
Your enemy is training and honing their skills; do the same.  
No matter how good you think you are, there’s always someone better. Prey you never meet them, and fight like hell when you do.  
It’s better to act and frag up than do nothing.  
As long as you can still think and move, you’re never truly unarmed. Cultivate your mind first, everything else second.  
Weapons and gear are great, but they mean less than zero if you don’t know to use them properly or how to act/react when combat kicks off and the drek starts flying.  
If you carry a gun, always keep one in the chamber and have extra ammo.  
Always carry, even if you’ve got magic.  
If you don’t carry a gun, use some other kind of weapon.  
Melee weapons don’t run out of ammo.  
No matter where you go, or who you deal with, always have a plan ready to either escape or kill everyone in the room.  
Always have a primary plan, and another plan for when that plans fails. If you run out of plans, make one up.  
Know when or when not to execute a plan.  
Rage doesn’t solve problems. The proper application of controlled force based on situational awareness, skill, experience, and training does.  
For those of you reading or learning about this stuff for the first time, pay attention and continue cultivating knowledge from a wide variety of sources. The only time you should stop learning and honing your skills is when you’re dead.

# BEFORE THE BATTLE BEGINS

Before we get too far into theory and technical details, I want to drive home one important concept: in combat, there’s no sure thing. Call it karma, fate, or just dumb luck, but unexpected things *will* happen. Combat is about stacking the odds in your favor through knowledge, preparation, and skill. It’s also about recognizing lucky breaks, because things can suddenly go your way or just as abruptly turn horribly against you. And the thing that I know for a fact is that that every fight I’ve ever been in started way before anyone was trying to harm me.

to use a gun, throw a punch, or gut someone with a knife. That all came later. Instead, they taught me what’s called “the tactical mindset.” At its core, the tactical mindset is about mentally preparing for combat before it happens and being ready to get through it. And the truth is, you don’t have to be a professional hoop-kicker or skull-cracker to benefit from it; anyone can.

> *Combat is a mental game, a battle of wits and nerve as much as raw strength or firepower. Unfortunately, too many focus more on the latter.*  
> *Fianchetto*

# Head on a Swivel

The first part of the tactical mindset is a simple yet often-neglected concept: situational awareness. Because what usually ends up killing you is something you didn’t see coming. The most effective way to prevent this is to constantly evaluate the environment and actively search for possible threats. Is that street sam on the corner showing any indications of an imminent attack (such as a tense posture, or hands approaching a weapon)? Or are they just minding their own business—and sizing you up as a possible threat? Constant situational re-evaluation needs to be developed to such a degree that it becomes automatic and second nature. You may end up with a rep for paranoia, but that’s preferable to death.

> *I prefer the descriptor “thorough” instead of paranoid.*  
> *Rigger X*

Despite advances in technology and magic, the best way to build situational awareness is through an individual’s natural senses—look, listen, and even smell what’s going on around you. And the one sense that cannot be overlooked is that gut instinct that says something is just *wrong*. Learn to listen and integrate that with what you observe. Your chances of avoiding problems altogether will skyrocket.

> *One example is to look at how the locals are reacting. Those who live in areas of constant strife develop a potent sixth sense to recognize the signs of trouble. I saw a lot of this in Bogotá during the Az-Am War. When the locals start quietly moving for cover, it’s a good idea to do the same.*  
> *Marcos*

# To Neutralize, or Not to Neutralize?

Once a potential threat is identified, it’s time for some threat analysis. Just because someone *can* be a threat doesn’t mean it *is*. And not all threats are created equal. That decked-out street

# Keeping Players Properly Paranoid

During a game session, player characters will face myriad threats and dangers. One way to highlight this is to have the PCs frequently make Perception tests to detect any possible dangers, even when said danger may be minimal or even non-existent. This can help create dramatic tension and provide opportunities for gameplay and plot progression, and it can help keep Perception tests from acting as a tell that something truly dangerous is afoot. GMs should be careful to not exasperate players by making them roll too much or exhaust them by keeping them in a constant state of tension/paranoia; as with all things in gamemastering, watch the players for cues as to how they are reacting.

Samurai eyeballing you on the corner may be a legit threat, but replace them with a scrawny ganger in cheap synthleathers; same threat level? But what happens when twenty of that ganger’s chummers show up and each of them is packing firearms? Or, that scrawny ganger is actually a street shaman with major mojo, what then? Determining the nature of the threat is only one part of the job—you’ll also have to determine if you have the capability of neutralizing said threat should it become necessary or deciding if it’s prudent to back off. Such is the nature of threat analysis before and during combat.

* It’s good tactical advice to assume that everyone and everything is a major threat until it’s proven otherwise—usually after they’ve been neutralized.  
  — Cayman

* That’s brutal, killing everyone that could be a threat?  
  — Treadle

* Don’t get hung up on terminology. Killing is only one method of neutralizing a threat, and usually not the preferred one. Less-than-lethal methods and evasion are other possibilities, along with simply removing a threat’s means or opportunity to attack. Despite what some people say, it’s not about body count; it’s about being effective.  
  — Rifleman

* The methods you use will also shape your rep. Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. Because in this biz, what goes around comes around.  
  — Hard Exit

# Always Practice Proper Recon

Part of maintaining a tactical mindset is gathering as much data as possible before combat operations—in other words, reconnaissance. Recon provides valuable data regarding any obstacles, possible threats, and environmental hazards. It’s vital for any kind of operational planning, be it an ambush or simply getting the layout of a location before a meet with Mr. Johnson.

> Still amazes me how many runners don’t do location recon before a job meet. Yeah, you may have met at specific location a million times before and may actually be best buds with Mr. Johnson. But things change, runners get hosed, or stupid unexpected drek just happens. Like it was said before, complacency and death go hand in hand in this biz.  
> — Danger Sensei

In any recon operation, you should always identify ways and routes out of danger in case the drek hits the fan. Part of surviving combat is knowing when and how to get out of the line of fire. The absolute worst time to figure that out is after it begins.

# Know Your Limits

One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was never to start a fight I couldn’t finish. Sounds obvious in retrospect, but people do stupid things in the heat of the moment. For those keeping the tactical mindset, it’s important to know the limits and capabilities of you and your team. Not every team can handle every threat or opponent, nor should they try. Some adversaries are just better than you, or some unexpected development may change the situational dynamic and put you at a massive disadvantage. This happens with alarming frequency. A good tactical mindset means being honest with yourself and the situation in order to act accordingly, forgoing ego and pride. Yeah, this could ding your rep, but reps can be repaired, and there’s always more nuyen out there to be earned. But if you’re dead, that’s it, game over.

* I agree with this in principle, but sometimes your rep is all you have. If that gets dinged too many times, you start getting offered nothing but drek jobs, suicide jobs, or worse, no jobs at all.

# Gearing Up For the Party

Now it’s time to start talking practical application, specifically weapons and gear. Anything we do in the shadows could turn into a clusterfrag at any moment. And like any other party, we have to dress and accessorize appropriately.

## Does this Armored Jacket Make My Butt Look Big?

One of the biggest mistakes I see is inappropriately equipping for the situation. You may be *really* attached to your tricked-out assault rifle, but that doesn’t mean you have to bring it to a meet. It’s also not a good idea to walk down the street in broad daylight with a full tactical loadout. Conversely, you don’t want to under-prepare, because you never know what may go down at any given moment.

Best advice is to equip for the situation at hand. For example, if you need to maintain a low-profile for some on-site recon, carry easily concealable kit. If you need to make a good first impression with a potential employer, spend some ’yen on some nice threads. But keep some defensive tools on hand.

But if you *know* Bad Things™ are going to happen, there are several considerations to factor in when determining what kind of kit to bring. And with that thought in mind …

# Locked, Loaded, and Ready to Roll

It can’t be said enough: There’s no way to plan for every contingency. But there are some principles one can follow to cover as many bases as possible. While the mileage of these principles may vary, these are a few of my personal favorites that have served me and others well.

## Weapon Selection

Combatants really love their weapons. Before going into combat, the first and primary factor in deciding a weapon loadout should be: “Am I proficient in using this?” If you’re not, then don’t carry it, period. If something is vital to the job, consider having someone else use it or relegate it as a secondary weapon.

The time to learn proficiency is during training, not during combat. Your primary weapon should be the one you’re most proficient with, but it’s also prudent to be proficient in a few select weapon types rather than mediocre at several. When the blood is flying and people are dying, you can’t waste time trying to remember how to use something. If you want to carry lots of toys, great; pick a few favorites, master those first, and only then move on to another.

But no matter what you carry or are proficient with, one should carry at least one primary weapon, one (or more) secondary/backup weapon(s), one melee weapon, and one weapon of last resort.

> * State-of-the-art weapons and accessories do not make up for a lack of training. Technology eventually fails, and when it does, all you have is your skill.  
> * Picador  
> * My twenty-year-old AK shoots great and has kept firing long after several so-called better weapons have failed. The most important thing about a gun is that when you pull the trigger, it fires.  
> * Stone  
> * This also brings to light a common issue with runner teams, especially ones brought together for a singular job. These ad hoc teams are often “come as you are” and might not have the all necessary weapon and skillsets required. In these cases, it’s necessary to plan tactical strategies around these deficiencies.  
> * Fianchetto  

Combat threats come from all ranges and angles. So you need to ask: Can you adequately respond to these threats? For example, taking only close-range weapons such as a shotgun or SMG through an open field where a sniper, machine gunner, or even a competent shooter with an assault rifle can engage you beyond your effective range is a bad situation to be in. However, those SMGs or shotguns are perfect for close-quarters action within a building or the back alleys of a choked urban environment because of their smaller size and maneuverability in tight confines.

It’s extremely difficult for an individual to carry a sufficient mix of weapons to deal with all ranged threats. That’s why it’s preferable to spread this out among a team. I advise using weapons that can engage at multiple range increments, and at least one that can engage at extreme ones.

> * Let’s not forget, combat spells are line-of-sight, without range limits. If it can be seen, it can be hit.  
> * Winterhawk  
> * And announces exactly where you and your team are. I won’t deny combat spells have their uses, but let’s not forget their drawbacks either.  
> * Hard Exit  

So what exactly should a proper loadout look like? That varies based on the job. But every team member should have at least a primary and secondary weapon they’re proficient with. In my educated opinion, a loadout should look something like this:

### 1. Long-range weapon

Sniper rifles, EBRs, and even most sporting rifles work best at long to extreme ranges. Machine

----

LOCKED, LOADED, AND READY TO ROLL // HONING YOUR EDGE


---


## 2. Medium and Short-Range Weapons

Assault rifles, carbines, SMGs and some shotguns work best at these ranges and are often used for the close-quarters battle situation. If encumbrance or ammo is an issue, machine pistols can theoretically fill in for an SMG. But like pistols, they’re mostly effective at shorter ranges.

## 3. Backup or Emergency Weapon

Typically a pistol of some type, although blades and other melee weapons can be used if desperate necessary. No matter what your job is, everyone should have a backup weapon.

## 4. One Melee Weapon

Sword, axe, spear, knife, or whatever—have one for those times when the fight gets up close and personal, even if you have a primary or secondary firearm.

## 5. A Weapon of Last Resort

Doesn’t matter but have something, *anything* for that last-ditch effort when every other option (or weapon) has been exhausted. I’ve even seen grenades being used as such.

## 6. Specialized or Heavy Weapons (Optional)

Sometimes an operation requires specific weapons that fall outside the normal parameters. These include but are not limited to: grenade launchers, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, anti-materiel rifles, or basic demolitions.

## 7. As Much Ammunition as You Can Carry

Unless you’re only packing melee weapons—not recommended—you’re going to need ammunition. While most firefights in the shadows tend to be brief, if your firearm runs dry, you’ll wish you had another clip.

> No matter what I’m doing, I always wear some basic armor, carry my primary sidearm (with at least two spare clips), and my trusty combat knife. Because you never know when you’re going to need to shoot someone in the face, or stab them in the throat … or if there’s cake.  
> — DangerSensei

> I’m noticing a distinct bias toward firearms here. What about those of us who prefer other weapons?  
> — Treadle

> Firearms are simply the most common weapon in combat. There are exceptions to every rule, but that’s for you to discuss with your team when planning.  
> — Rifleman

# Armor Selection

Combatants tend to favor the offensive capability of their weapons of choice, but then treat armor as an afterthought. Reasons range from the cost (armor is typically more expensive than most firearms) to the idea that it’s better to get them before they get you. And while that concept has some credibility, the problem is that you’re not always going to get the first strike, let alone neutralize the opposition before they return the favor. No matter what the combat situation is, sometimes your armor determines whether you’re walking away from a fight or being carried out in a body bag.

* Weapons and armor are in a constant state of one-upmanship. As weapons become more lethal and effective, armor technology scrambles to meet the new threat with each new innovation. And then, the cycle repeats just as armor catches up. Currently, we’re at the point where offensive weapons have the upper hand.  
  - Red Anya

Current armor design trends also incorporate additional secondary benefits and utilities. Basic modifications can protect users from hazards such as extreme weather conditions, fire, and chemical attacks, to name just a few. These utilities also provide a platform to store and access common weapon types.

Make sure your armor is at least adequate for the job. Walking into an active firefight with only armored clothing is a good way to have a really bad time. Likewise, trying to sneak around in full security or mil-spec armor (assuming you can get some) is not going to go well unless you have some serious tricks in reserve.

* Many magicians like to argue that certain spells will mitigate the negative factors of teammates wearing heavier armor in situations requiring stealth. While this is true, there’s just as likely a chance a good security mage or spirit will detect the spell’s effect. In that case, you might as well go hit the alarm yourself.  
  - Hard Exit

* Before this devolves into a “magic vs. technology” flame war, let me point out that both have their benefits and drawbacks. So just plan accordingly, okay?  
  - Glitch

* I still think we can all agree that the best way to survive any fight is just to avoid it in the first place.  
  - Lyran

* Yeah, but that’s also like saying you’ll win the game by not showing up to play.  
  - Slamm-0!

# Gear Consideration and Selection

Weapons and armor are primary considerations when it comes to a combat loadout, but there’s still more to consider. Combat isn’t just about killing and not getting killed; it’s about completing a mission or objective. When considering other pieces of kit to bring, ask yourself the following questions.

_Do you need any specialized gear, and how are you going to store/transport it?_ Like weapons, ammo, and armor, specialized gear has weight and takes up space that could be filled by ammo or other tools. If it’s vital, figure it out. If you can find an alternate tool or piece of gear, consider it.

* And before anyone asks, “Why can’t I just store my gear or weapons with the rigger?” I’ll say this: My vehicle isn’t always going to be at your disposal while on the job. And to be honest, it slots me off when my high-performance vehicle with nova-hot SOTA gear is treated as nothing but a mobile storage unit.  
  - Turbo Bunny

* I’ve made a nice chunk of cred over the years selling gear from former teammates.  
  - Clockwork

* Normally I’d say that’s repulsive, but I‘ve done the same.  
  - Turbo Bunny

_How long do you plan on being in the field?_  
While geared more toward the military/paramilitary types, it’s also something most shadowrunners should consider. The longer you’re in the field, the more likely you’re going to have to bring gear for basic self-care and/or survival. This means you may have to compromise on weapons or ammo.

_Always bring a medkit._ Everyone on the team should have one, preferably more, even if they’re bare bones. And I shouldn’t have to explain why.

_Are you too attached to something?_ Something any professional better accept right fragging now is that you may have to sacrifice your favorite piece of gear. Yeah, you may be out thousands of nuyen, or you may have to leave behind a precious weapon focus. But gear can be replaced, your sorry hoop can’t. Rule of thumb is that if a weapon can’t be fixed in the field or its lack of ammo is detrimental to the mission/job or the team’s overall wellbeing, then ditch it because it’s dead weight.

* This! Fragging major pet peeve of mine. I run into this mostly with deckers and riggers who are too damned attached to their decks, drones, or vehicles. But shooters and their precious guns are also high on the list. If we can salvage your gear, fine. But the second it becomes a detriment to my survival, I’ll chuck it myself. And if you give me any static about it, I’ll geek you and ditch your dead weight without a second thought.

## WHERE’D *THAT* COME FROM?

With the myriad of weapon, armor, and gear options available in *Shadowrun, Sixth World*, players may try and carry their entire arsenals with them at all times, just in case. This may cause difficulties for the GM in trying to challenge PCs during a session, especially if they have powerful weaponry. To mitigate this, there are methods a GM can employ.

**First:** Have the players divulge specifically what items they’re taking on a particular operation. A GM can keep track of what a player has at any given time so that too-convenient items just don’t show up without any logical reason. This also gets the players thinking about kit prioritization and also how to plan effectively.

**Second:** Have the players explain exactly how and where they store gear and weapons on their person. While this may seem nit-picky, there are several gear/weapon storage options available and specifically designed for this exact situation.

**Third:** The GM should make use of the Fatigued status (p. 52, *SR6*) when appropriate, if the players are unreasonable about the amount of equipment they carry.

# ASSEMBLING A PROFICIENT COMBAT TEAM

Okay, this next part is not about assembling a proficient *shadowrun* team. It is about building a *combat* team where the individual members combine their skills and resources for the purpose of engaging in combat operations. While a shadowrun team should be proficient in combat, that’s still only part of what’s required during a run. I’m simply ignoring all these other aspects and focusing on when the bullet hits the bone because this is a data file about combat.

### TYPES OF TEAMS

There are all sorts of team dynamics, but they generally boil down to two types: ad hoc and fixed.

**Ad hoc teams** are when professionals with specific or multiple skillsets are brought together to perform a certain task, job, or mission. These professionals may or may not have worked together previously or even know each other. But when Johnson contacted their fixer, that fixer decided to call these slags. And when it’s all over, they’re likely to disband.

Ad hoc teams can be tailored to meet specific job requirements—at least, that’s the theory. It’s difficult to know exactly what skills will be required, because jobs often go in odd directions. That is, unless Mr. Johnson already has a plan and just needs professionals to carry it out.

Then there are **fixed teams**. These are permanent or semi-permanent teams of professionals who’ve banded together long-term and take jobs as a group. They tend to have a fixed roster but occasionally bring in others if the situation requires.

Having worked together frequently, fixed teams often have a level of cohesion and coordination that goes above and beyond ad hoc teams. They know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and how they will react, and they’re better able to work together. The downside of fixed teams is the risk of tactical deficiency. Introducing temporary members into the mix risks messing with team cohesiveness, which is not ideal in combat.

### ROLL CALL: BUILDING THE COMBAT TEAM

The primary factor above all else for a combat team is their ability to function effectively as a cohesive unit. Teams *will* live or die based on this. Professionals are individuals with their own needs, wants, personal agendas, and methodologies. These can (and often do) come into conflict with other team members unless strong leadership is established. You don’t have to like each other; you just have to work together until the job or mission is done.

> *Not every team assembled is able to accomplish that. It may start out that way, but it’s usually not long before someone’s ego is bruised, or things go sideways and start to fracture. Hopefully, the fixer is good enough to know who can work together and who can’t, because that’s their job.*  
> — DangerSensei

> *It’s also common for pros to settle issues after the job is done. As long as it’s not during, I don’t care.*  
> — Am-mut

> *Some still try. Fog of combat gets mighty thick and people think “well, things just happen.” If you gotta beef with someone on your team, keep your head on a swivel because you never know.*  
> — Cayman

> *A few weeks back I signed on as a replacement because their previous decker got tagged by a GOD tracker team. The team’s adept kept bombarding me with disgusting offers for a “good time” once the job was done. Everyone else thought it was funny and told me, “that’s just how he is.” Job went pretty smooth, but once we got our payday, the adept tried once more. So I shot him in both knees and thanked him. It turned out to be a good time after all!*

### TEAM POSITIONS

A combat team needs to be able to work together like a well-lubricated machine. And like any ma-


---


chine, a combat team is only as good as its parts.  
But what are they?  

The most vital position is the **team leader**. No matter the job, objective, or team makeup, someone has to be in charge. In a military unit, the team leader has the highest rank. But in the shadows, rank usually means frag all, in the rare cases where it exists. Team leaders on shadow teams are followed because they have the skills and they get things done, or they’re at least really good at faking it.  

> Leading in the shadows is brutal, especially for rookies or first-timers. You’ll be tested at every turn, your every decision challenged by people who think they know better—and sometimes really do. Good leaders get past that and make things happen. Unfortunately, how you do that is something each leader has to figure out for themselves.  
> — Mihoshi Oni  

> And remember—you’ll screw up. When that happens, own up, find a way to fix or make it right by your team. And don’t do it again.  
> — Hard Exit  

In the shadows, team leaders are constantly evaluating the situation and adapting as needed. However, each has their own style of leading. With modern communications and matrix technology, team leaders can lead remotely instead of from the front. This method can be considered cowardly in some circles. But it doesn’t matter how a team is led, as long as it works. But as essential as a leader is, a team also needs a chain of command. If something happens to the leader, someone else needs to take command immediately; and so on down the line until no one’s left.  

The second major position within the combat team are the **direct combatants**. If you haven’t guessed, these are the slags who actually engage the enemy. Individual styles, skills, and preferences may vary, but direct combatants are typically (but not always) going to be your mercs, street samurai, adepts, walking tanks, and other assorted hurt-specialists such as snipers and heavy weapons experts. But however they do the things they do, as a group the direct combatants at minimum should have the ability to engage an enemy at multiple ranges by multiple means. Additionally, team combat duties are often broken further down depending on team makeup or specific mission needs. A sniper performing overwatch or a troll merc playing bodyguard for the team’s magician or on-site decker are just two examples.  

**Magical support** is a crucial part of modern combat. In pre-combat operations, magicians can provide recon through astral projection or use of spirits. Their spells can conceal or augment team members. During combat, magicians provide direct tactical support with spells or spirits. For all their advantages, magicians can also be one of the biggest liabilities if not utilized and protected properly. Because like a gun that’s out of ammo, a drained magician quickly becomes dead weight.  

> If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that this joker has a thing against magicians.  
> — Axis Mundi  

> You don’t know any better. While the Colonel here is being slightly overdramatic, he has no bias and is simply being pragmatic. Our abilities are an asset, but like any asset it needs to be properly managed to be effective. And to be blunt, most magicians aren’t exactly known for our physical prowess.  
> — Winterhawk  

> Still, a combat mage cutting loose is one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen.  
> — Lyran  

With wireless functionality completely integrated into all facets of life, **Matrix support** is more important than ever in modern combat. For better or worse, most if not all combat technology is routed through or augmented by wireless functionality. The benefits are real, but so is the constant threat of these systems being compromised. In most situations, Matrix support operates off-site or at least away from the front-line fighting. This allows Matrix specialists to fully immerse themselves in their task. This isn’t always possible where direct, on-site Matrix support is required, however, and this is when they’re most vulnerable.  

During combat, Matrix support has two primary objectives: attack an enemy via the Matrix and protect their team from Matrix-based attacks. Such attacks can range from “soft” attacks such as feeding the enemy false data all the way to “hard” attacks that damage gear and hardware. Their second objective, which runs parallel with the first, involves protecting and maintaining the lines of communication or tactical networks with friendlies, especially when operations spread them out over great distances or out of direct line of sight. Elements of a combat team that have their communications compromised can be quickly isolated and eliminated.  

> One of the first, most important targets for any military commander has always been the enemy’s communications. Today, most major attacks begin with a Matrix assault followed up by direct combat action.  
> — Picador  

With its reputation of being “the cavalry,” **vehicle and drone support** offers great tactical flexibility. They provide direct fire support with heavy ordnance such as machine guns, rockets, or cannons. A rigger vehicle can also be employed as a mobile command and control vehicle; especially

if with equipped with drones. Depending on their type and their modifications, drones are a critical force multiplier and can act as a proxy for the rigger’s physical presence on a battlefield. Drones are perfect for recon operations, providing valuable battlefield data before and during a mission.

> Something else I’d like to point out is that we can be taken out of the action, and yet our rides are perfectly fine. So it wouldn’t kill any of you to learn how to drive, or at least know how to turn on the damn autonav.  
> Turbo Bunny

The final position—that’s not really a dedicated position—is a catch-all for whatever else a team needs. These **miscellaneous support** positions are often secondary roles/jobs for other team members or assigned to team members who may or may not be the most tactically inclined but are still necessary. One example of this is a combat medic. A team may have a dedicated medic, or another team member (such as the face) may be cross-trained for this role. Another support role might simply be carrying all the extra gear and ammo. Not glamorous, but necessary.

> Such team members are also additional sets of eyes to detect danger or another brain to solve problems, or another gun to at least shoot back at the enemy.  
> Danger Sensei

No matter what your team position is, I cannot stress enough the idea of knowing the jobs above and below you. I touched on this earlier when talking about team leader and the chain of command, but it goes beyond that. At bare minimum, everyone on the team should have access to and be basically proficient with most if not all weapons carried by the team. If your teammate goes down; you may need to pick up their weapon and use it.

And finally, for Ghost’s sake, make sure you have adequate transportation. Not every rigger is going to have a vehicle that can fit everyone. Whatever your situation, make sure you have enough seats in your ride to get out.

# COMBAT PRINCIPLES AND TACTICS

There’s an old saying that’s become a maxim in military parlance: “no plan survives contact with the enemy.” In a nutshell, it means that extensive planning and preparation can still end up amounting to nothing once that point of no return is passed and combat actually begins. Combat is fast, chaotic, and brutal. It’s also not the time for half-measures, but I already made my feelings clear on that.

----

# TEAM DYNAMICS

One of the most common misconceptions in *Shadowrun* (and RPGs in general) is that there are certain positions on a team/group that must be filled, otherwise the team is useless. This can cause players to feel obligated to play characters they aren’t interested in, just for the sake of having one.  
This should never be the case.

*Shadowrun* is designed to be played around the team, not the other way around. The Sixth World is full of different jobs; it’s a matter of the players finding/accepting the right job from the right Mr. Johnson (or for a GM to create the right jobs if necessary). If a team is light on combat specialists, then take jobs that are (hopefully) expected to be combat-light. Or if the team is combat-focused, they may decide to take mostly high-threat jobs.

If a team is unable to be as selective as they want regarding employment opportunities, then another possibility is to employ contacts or NPC characters to fill any necessary positions. For all intents and purposes, they’re simply another runner on the team; the only difference is that the GM controls them.

----

Combat is fluid and dynamic, so there’s no definitive answer on how to win an engagement. But, there are some tried-and-true principles and tactics one can incorporate into their battle plan.

## WHEN IT’S “GO TIME”

In any combat situation, there’s always a moment when you know drek is about to down, and it’s way past the point of no return. This has many names, but I prefer “go time.” This is the point where you have to fully commit and engage your adversary/threat or enact your battle plan and deal with whatever happens thereafter.

While combat has multiple angles and factors, a combatant will be either on the offensive or on the defensive; there’s no such thing as a neutral position when it’s go time. Both have benefits and drawbacks that combatants will have to work through.

## OFFENSIVE COMBAT PRINCIPLES

When going on the offensive, there’re multiple theories on how to do it. But they all boil down to two concepts: coming in hard or coming in silent. In my personal opinion, go with the silent option whenever possible to maintain the element of surprise while also (hopefully) catching your enemy off guard or at a disadvantage. And while objectives vary, I’m a staunch proponent of striking an opponent before they even realize I’m there, then fading away. However, not everyone buys into that MO, and there’ll be times when the enemy knows, or at least suspects, you’re coming. In those situations, you need to come hard and fast by pro-

**HONING YOUR EDGE // COMBAT PRINCIPLES AND TACTICS**

jecting enough offensive force that there’s nothing  
they can do about it except to embrace the suck.

No matter how you attack, employ the principle of **shock and awe**. The concept is that when you attack, hit swiftly and with enough force to not only overwhelm but cause chaos among the enemy’s ranks.

If you can’t sneak up on them, bulldoze them.  
In order to pull any of this off, one needs to have **the right tools for the job**. As I discussed before, your combat loadout should have been determined based on pre-battle intelligence, and you should be able to engage the enemy at multiple ranges. Hopefully, proper weapons and gear have been selected based on the mission’s parameters, because I can tell you from firsthand experience that few things suck more than assaulting a target only to find your weapons don’t do drek.

> Fragging right on there. Early in my career I was talked into leaving my old Panther behind on a run because the “leader” fragged up on the intel regarding on-site security. It would’ve come in handy when the two trolls in heavy sec armor we encountered, who the boss missed, rushed us. Thankfully we improvised and dropped a cargo container on them. But that took time we didn’t have and cost us a shooter.  
> Cayman

As soon as combat begins, the first task to achieve is **prioritizing targets**. In traditional military operations, this is the elimination of key objectives such as communications. Or it may be the neutralization of the greatest threat. We’ve all heard the phrase “geek the mage first,” but that’s not always the case. The enemy mage may be a less imminent threat than, say, the troll adept about to plant a battle axe into your face, or the dwarf who’s about to fire a rocket launcher up your hoop.

Decisions, decisions …  
No matter the objective, you need to determine the best way of conducting operations (duh), which means **finding a target’s weaknesses and exploiting them**. For example, it’s usually bad for most of us to go hand-to-hand with most trolls. So the best way to take them down could be ranged combat, magic, or … run. Or it can be as simple as learning where the enemy is weakest in terms of strategy, tactics, or numbers and go against that. No combatant, no matter how powerful, is completely invulnerable; there’s always an Achilles’ Heel. You just have to find it.

> Or just keep hammering away until they go down.  
> Chainmaker  
> Viable, but not a tactic you can easily sustain without numbers and time on your side. And it’s been my experience that most runner teams don’t have much of either once the shooting starts.  
> Rifleman

When things go sideways, **be ready to adapt**. Teammates will go down, shots will be missed, targets will have the bad form to not die, and enemy reinforcements will arrive with annoying frequency. Or any number of “what the frag” moments will simply happen. Things will go wrong, so be ready for it.

To keep that adaptability and other options open, **be able to maneuver and retain your mobility**. Even with modern tech, it’s more difficult to hit a mobile than a static target. No matter how tough you are, the last situation you want to be in is out in the open, pinned down, or boxed in. It gives your enemy the opportunity to zero in and deploy The Big Hurt.

Being mobile and able to maneuver also helps you **keep the initiative**. The last thing you want is for your enemy to regroup and counterattack. Keep them on their back foot. You should dictate the terms of the battle, not the other way around.

To accomplish this while maneuvering, **use cover and terrain** to mask your movements and protect yourself and your team from enemy return fire. Combat maneuvers (which we’ll get to later) are specifically designed for teams to work together; often using a combination of speed and cover to accomplish this. If you find yourself in a situation where there’s no cover, either find or make some.

----

### THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COVER AND CONCEALMENT

One of the biggest mistakes players make is thinking that cover and concealment are the same. Concealment simply prevents someone from being seen. Cover provides at least some protection enemy attack, but under some circumstances can also provide concealment. A wall made of heavy materials is a good example of both. When determining what is cover or concealment, players and the GM should consider what’s being used and how resistant said objects would be to incoming attack. For example, a metal dumpster may be resistant to smaller weapons such as pistols or SMGs, but assault rifles and larger weapons could punch right through. Whatever the situation is, the GM should be judicious in their application of how good cover and concealment are.

----

No matter how good things are going, all it takes is one bad break or one lucky break for your enemy to completely change the battle’s initiative. A good leader can recognize when the situation is untenable and **knows when it’s time to abort**. This principle is hard to swallow for many professionals because they see it as failure or cowardice. Sometimes you have to back off and regroup or come up with another plan. Losing a fight sucks, but dying sucks even more.

> Speaking of rep, those who gain one for needlessly endangering their team through poor leadership, recklessness, or wanton disregard don’t last long. Either the enemy takes them out, or the team does.  
> Marcos

If you do have to abort or even if the mission goes off without a hitch, **make sure you have your egress planned and exit routes secured.** Taking out the target or securing an objective is great, but it means drek if the team can’t exfiltrate from the area. Unless you’ve eliminated all opposition, chances are you’ve slotted off a lot of people looking to take you out. Securing your egress increases your odds of collecting that payday.

> And just because you make it out, don’t think that the run is over. It’s a good chance whoever you just pulled a job against will be gunning for you for a while. Make sure your safehouses are secure until the heat dies down and it’s safe to contact Mr. Johnson. Then collect your payday.  
> Stone

## Defensive Combat Principles

Things are a little different being on the defensive. It requires some slightly different tactics and principles; especially if you’re defending a static position or where your mobility and maneuverability are limited.

When fighting on the defensive, **early warning and detection** of an attack are critical. They allow defenders to fortify their position, formulate a defensive plan, and maybe—just *maybe*—counterattack and frag the living hell out of them.

Even more for the defender, **cover and concealment** are your friend. In a defensive position, build up your defenses for enhanced protection. And if you’re unlucky enough to be ambushed, cover may be the only thing keeping you alive.

One of the few true advantages a defender has is the use of **fortifications**. From dedicated heavy walls to makeshift obstacles, the main purpose of fortifications is to frustrate an attacking force and buy the defender precious time.

Whatever your tactical situation, know that **most offensive tactical principles can also be used defensively.** Recognizing the threat, prioritizing targets, and executing the plan are the same while on defense. If a defender is able to blunt or slow an attacker’s advance, this gives the defender a chance to **counterattack.** Nothing ruins an attacker’s day more when a target turns the tables on them.

# Small Unit Tactics and Combat Maneuvers

If combat principles cover the overall picture, then Small Unit Tactics (SUT) are the details and actions that make those principles happen. SUT are specific types of actions or combat maneuvers undertaken by a team working in conjunction to gain a tactical advantage during combat. While some of these maneuvers are geared more toward offense or defense, others can be adjusted on the fly depending on the situation.

### Using Small Unit Tactics

In *SR6*, Small Unit Tactics (SUT) is a knowledge skill that covers the use, knowledge, and utilization of combat maneuvers. During combat, it can be used to perform a specific combat maneuver to gain specific benefits.

In order to enact/attempt an SUT maneuver, at least one team member **must have the SUT knowledge skill as well as the Influence active skill** (to perform a maneuver or instruct others how to perform it). Bonuses gained from the Leadership or Instruction specialties can be used in combat maneuver tests. During combat, SUT maneuvers are considered major actions, but can also be “prepped” before initiative is rolled. A Perception + Intuition (threshold determined by the GM) test can be used to identify a maneuver being attempted.

To enact a combat maneuver:

1. Designate a Leader. This team member will direct or command others on how to perform the maneuver.

2. On their initiative, the Leader will perform an Influence + Logic test to meet or exceed the maneuver’s threshold. Those participating in the maneuver must hold on to a Major Action to use during the Leader’s initiative. Team members with the prerequisite skills can treat a SUT maneuver test as a Teamwork test per normal rules (p. 36, *SR6*).  
**If all team members participating in an SUT maneuver have the Small Unit Tactics knowledge skill, combat maneuvers are treated as minor actions.**

3. Tally all hits from the combat maneuver test to see if it is successful. If the team beats the threshold by two, they gain a point of situational Edge in addition to the listed bonus (the Leader decides which team member can use the point of Edge).

4. Enact the maneuver, apply bonuses, and make any additional skill tests. **Note:** A combat maneuver is performed on the lowest initiative score of the participants.

# BOUNDING OVERWATCH

**THRESHOLD: 2 (WITH COVER)  
OR 3 (WITHOUT COVER)**

Bounding Overwatch is used when a team must move across a battlefield, taking advantage of cover. One team member engages a target(s) with a ranged weapon—preferably a full-auto capable firearm—allowing the rest of the team to advance. Once all team members have moved, a secondary shooter provides the primary covering fire. This maneuver can be performed with or without cover.  
*(Notes/Benefits: –3 to enemy AR.)*

# COUNTER PEEL

**THRESHOLD: 3**

This is used when withdrawing from a combat zone or moving to find better cover. The participants form a sloped or diagonal battle line, allowing each team member a clear field of fire. The team member closest to the enemy then withdraws down the line, while under supportive fire from the rest of the team, moving to a position beyond the end of the battle line. The process repeats until all team members have moved or cleared a combat zone. To perform this maneuver, each participant must have a ranged weapon.  
*(Notes/Benefits: +3 to DR.)*

# CREEPING BARRAGE

**THRESHOLD: 4**

A popular tactic used by combat teams with heavy fire support, the Creeping Barrage has two components: the advancing team members and a fire-support element (rocket, grenade, or mortar). The fire-support elements deploy their ordnance safely ahead and along the path of the advancing team to clear enemies, traps, or obstacles. The maneuver is then repeated as the fire support “creeps” their ordnance forward. Coordinating the fire support and team members during this maneuver can be tricky; mistakes (glitches) often result in friendly fire incidents.  
*(Notes/Benefits: To perform, fire-support elements must be able to engage the target. After a successful attack roll by the fire-support elements, the advancing team gains a +3 to AR while opposition suffers –3 to DR.)*

# CROSSFIRE

**THRESHOLD: 3**

The Crossfire maneuver is meant to position friendly forces in such a way that the enemy takes fire from at least two different directions. Before the maneuver is enacted, the team leader must first determine where best to position their people. Best utilized as an ambush, the Crossfire maneuver can also be used during combat.  
*(Notes/Benefits: Before SUT maneuver test is made, the team leader makes a Perception + Intuition (2) test to determine participant placement. If maneuver succeeds, attackers gain a +2 to AR and defenders have a –3 penalty to DR.)*

# DIAMOND FORMATION

**THRESHOLD: 2**

The diamond formation is typically employed by four participants and is designed to provide a team a 360-degree field of observation while moving. This increases the chances of perceiving and responding to an enemy threat. Traditionally the team leader is in the front of the formation with two members flanking behind and to the left or right, with the final member in the back. When responding to threats or changing direction, the new front is based on which direction the formation travels or engages. Additional members can be added as needed or take up position in the center.  
*(Notes/Benefits: Lowers the threshold on all Perception Tests vs. an ambush by 2. If enacted before combat begins, add +2 to all participating team members’ initiative scores.)*

# DOG PILE

**THRESHOLD: SPECIAL**

The Dog Pile is a coordinated hand-to-hand/close combat swarm attack. Attackers focus their attack on a single target and attack simultaneously, targeting limbs or the body to disable or subdue the target. Once the target is subdued, the attack can cease … but most often don’t.  
*(Notes/Benefits: At least two attackers are necessary for this maneuver, but no SUT test is needed. Attackers simply hold their actions and attack simultaneously using a standard teamwork test. For every two hits, the attackers gain +1 to DV for subdual.)*

# DYNAMIC ENTRY

**THRESHOLD: 3 (4 WHEN UTILIZING THROWN EXPLOSIVES)**

Developed by law-enforcement teams to deal with hostage situations and barricaded subjects, the tactic was adopted by military units as urban warfare became more prevalent. The concept for this maneuver is for an entry team to overwhelm a target before they can react or impede their response. To perform this maneuver, a team lines or “stacks” up outside the entrance of the target area. One team member then quickly opens (or if necessary breaches) the door by blasting the locks or door hinges with either high-powered (typical-


---


ly shotgun) rounds or placed explosive charges, or they employ an entry device. The stacked participants then rush in and peel to the left or right (each member alternating) to scan the target area and quickly bring weapons to bear on hostiles, with the door breacher following in last.  
One popular variation is to employ thrown explosives, most commonly flash-bang grenades, after the door is breached and before the team makes entry.  
(Notes/Benefits: To perform this maneuver, there must be at least two to three participants: one to breach, one to make initial entry, and if explosives are being used, one to employ. If successful, participants gain +2 to their AR in addition to any benefits from the explosive device. If an entry team can employ this maneuver as an ambush, the bonus to their AR increases to +3.)

## Flank  
**Threshold: 3**  
Similar to Crossfire, the Flank maneuver is used during combat. To flank an opponent requires at least two combat elements. One is a covering element that engages the enemy while the other flanking element maneuvers around the enemy’s position to get on their sides or behind them. The flanking element can use stealth to cover their maneuvering or do it in the open. Once the maneuver is accomplished, the flankers add their weapons’ fire or other attacks to the covering element.  
(Notes/Benefits: If the maneuver is successful, participants receive a +2 to their AR while the flanked target is at –2 to their DR. If the flanking elements approach undetected, increase the AR bonus to +3.)

## Shield Walk  
**Threshold: 3**  
Inspired by the phalanxes of old, the shield walk is used when cover isn’t available and a combat team needs to maneuver while under fire. Maneuver basics are simple: One team member carries a large ballistic shield, while another participant follows behind to gain the shield’s advantages and return fire as they move in unison. The more shields in play, the more participants can benefit. This maneuver can also be used while moving behind an armored vehicle or heavy drone in place of a portable shield.  
(Notes/Benefits: A portable ballistic shield can be used to protect one additional team member. A large combat drone or small vehicle can protect two or three team members depending on their size. A large armored vehicle can protect three or four team members depending on size (gamemaster discretion prevails in these situations). Protect-

## Slicing the Pie  
**Threshold: Special**  
This defensive maneuver is used by a single operator in conjunction with cover and/or concealment. The operator stands back from and uses the corner of the cover/concealment in order to obscure their profile while slowly moving laterally, exposing just enough of their body gain a sight profile on the target. Slicing the Pie is best used in an urban or indoor environment and with the element of surprise or as an ambush.  
**(Notes/Benefits:** For every two hits on the SUT test, add +1 to operator’s DR.)  

## Suppressive Fire  
**Threshold: 2, w/ special rules**  
Suppressive fire is a maneuver that can be performed by a single or multiple shooters. The idea is to use a full-auto-capable weapon to spray fire in an arc, targeting an area rather than a specific individual or object in order to catch as many combatants as possible.  
**(Notes/Benefits:** To perform this maneuver, the attackers must have full-auto-capable firearms and sufficient ammunition. When making the SUT test, the number of total hits determines how many targets the attackers can hit with an attack roll. Each target reduces their DR by the base Damage Value of the weapon, and reduces their AR by half that, rounded up.)  

## Tactical Networks  
Communication and coordination have been primary concerns of battlefield commanders since organized warfare began. In the digital, AR/VR-laden battlefields of the Sixth World with the insane amount of combat elements that need to be directed, these concerns are even more prevalent.  

In recent years, the advent of tactical networks has enabled this level of coordination enhancement to continue. Tactical networks have advanced command and control to the point where everyone linked in can benefit from advanced combat data, leading to better overall performance.  

Past tactical network technology relied on bulky terminals that made them troublesome despite the benefits. And centralizing most, if not all, of a team’s combat information on one device makes it a prime target for enemies. But despite these drawbacks, the technology is popular and here to stay.  

Currently several brands of tac-net systems exist, most of them with the same general capabilities. It wasn’t until early 2080 that an upstart tech company called Pantheon Industries blindsided the big tech corps with the release of the M-TOC™ next-generation tactical network system.  

## M-TOC  
_(Mobile Tactical Operations Center)_  
**Tactical Network**  
Like previous generations of tac-nets, the M-TOC is a man-portable network communication terminal roughly fifty percent the size of a standard cyberdeck. It can act on its own or link to a cyberdeck or RCC. The M-TOC works by accessing and correlating data from commlinks, sensors, smart weapon systems, audio and visual cybernetic augmentations, and other external sources.  

What makes the M-TOC stand out from other tac-nets is the use of special proprietary programs made specifically for it called Tac-Apps. These provide extra functionality and capabilities, similar to cyberdeck programs. Tac-Apps can be swapped as needed for specific mission profiles allowing for unprecedented customization and versatility.  

The M-TOC requires an operator to keep the system running properly. Typically this is a Matrix specialist, but a rigger with appropriate skills and gear can also do it. Whoever maintains the network also grants users access to all pertinent information gathered.  

Currently, the M-TOC comes in three models—the Mark I, II, and III—each with its own capabilities and utilities. Each M-TOC comes with the following capabilities standard:  
* Enhanced audio and image link  
* Team member biomonitor  
* Team member weapon status/access (ammo count, operational status, biometric access)  
* Access to linked team members’ gear (includes commlinks and other communications gear)  
* Real-time tactical and strategic evaluation software  
* GPS and mapsoft navigation software  

## M-TOC Mark I  
The Mark I was designed for security and law enforcement officers during situations requiring enhanced coordination, such as hostage situations, when specialized response teams are unavailable. It was designed to be cost effective, so it can be distributed among rank-and-file patrol officers. The Mark I also features standard enhanced threat detection, identification friend/foe (IFF) software, and limited enhanced targeting for smartgun-equipped weapons.

# RUNNING THE M-TOC

M-TOC has several specific functions that are easily described and quantifiable in the descriptions, but one of its primary functions is more abstract in nature: the ability for PCs to use the M-TOC in combat situations to collect Edge above and beyond their limits, store that Edge, and share it among those linked into the network. The number of Edge points that can be stored is equal to the M-TOC’s device rating. This Edge can be stored when a player finds a situation where they earn more Edge than they can keep per the rules. Players can transfer any personal or stored Edge through the M-TOC system via a minor action. The normal rules of when situational Edge leaves apply (see p. 45, *SR6*).

To help explain how this works in-universe, the M-TOC constantly gathers new information through the tactical and strategic evaluation software, allowing players to make more informed decisions about their next course of action.

Operating an M-TOC is the same as operating a cyberdeck, but without any hacking capabilities. The only Matrix attributes M-TOCs have are Data Processing and Firewall (see M-TOC Stats table below), or they can take on the attribute ratings of whatever Matrix device they’re linked to.

> **Notes:** Lowers the threshold by –1 for Perception tests to detect ambush. IFF software provides a +1 to Perception tests to determine if a target is carrying concealed weapons and to identify subjects via facial recognition software. Also grants a +1 to AR for all linked smartgun weapons. The Mark I can handle up to nine users.

## M-TOC MARK II

Designed for front-line military units, the Mark II has some of the same capabilities as the Mark I but is more specialized toward combat operations rather than law-enforcement/security duties. The Mark II is also known for being physically resistant to external and Matrix damage. And thanks to modular components, it is easier to repair in the field.

> **Notes:** Lowers threshold by –2 for Perception tests to detect ambush. Grants +1 to AR for all linked smartgun weapons. Enhanced encryption raises the threshold for all Cracking tests by +1. Modular construction lowers the threshold for repairing damage by –2. Rugged construction grants a –1 to all physical damage taken. The Mark II can handle up to 15 users.

## M-TOC MARK III

Designed specifically for use by Special Forces–type units, the Mark III features some of the most advanced tactical software on the market, resulting in a network that’s harder to crack and assists users with their own hacking attempts while still providing some of the best targeting enhancement known. All of these benefits come at a cost, of course. To prevent system overload, Pantheon had to cap the number of active users. While somewhat limiting, the relatively small numbers of SF teams made this a minor drawback.

> **Notes:** Lowers threshold by –1 to all Perception tests to detect ambush. Grants +2 to AR for all linked and smartgun weapons. Enhanced encryption raises the threshold for enemy Cracking tests by +3. Modular construction lowers the threshold for repairing damage by –2. Rugged construction grants a –1 to all physical damage taken. Because of its specialized nature, the Mark III can only handle up to 10 members.

# TAC-APPS AND RELATED GEAR

Similar to cyberdeck programs, Tac-Apps are programs specifically for use by an M-TOC to customize the network for a user’s specific needs. Each M-TOC has a number of active program slots for running Tac-Apps.

# ARTILLERY BARRAGE

This app provides additional targeting data for launch-type weapons such as grenade launchers, rocket launchers, or mortars, making them more accurate. It also enables a shooter to rain down fire from a smartgun-equipped assault rifle, machine gun, or assault cannon as if it were a miniature artillery piece.

> **Rules:** +1 to dice pool for grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and mortars. No weapon-related penalties for shooting assault rifles, machine guns, or assault cannons when app is active. Shooter must still have at least some line of sight or know a target’s location.

# Co-Pilot
This app allows a team member to take control of a vehicle or drone linked into the network, so a rigger can focus on other tasks. Controlling a vehicle or drone with this app isn’t considered optimal.  
**Rules:** When controlling a vehicle with this app, the new operator/driver can do so with their commlink or AR gloves, but at a –1 dice pool penalty. When controlling drones, the new operator can only issue commands as if in the captain’s chair.

# Door Gunner
The Door Gunner app features advanced control and targeting software that allows a secondary team-member to control a mounted, remote-operation-capable vehicle weapon. Because of this app’s narrow focus and SOTA software code, “it’s just like having the weapon in your hands,” as their advertising slogan says.  
**Rules:** This app enables a new operator/gunner to control a vehicle weapon with their commlink or AR glove with no penalties. However, the operator must be able to receive smartlink targeting data.

# ECM Warrior II
Matrix asset denial and attacks are mainstays of modern combat. To assist in attacking enemy networks and defending their own, the ECM warrior is designed to give an operator extra “electronic ammo” to engage enemy hackers and help cut through any noise.  
**Rules:** +2 to all offensive Cracking tests while using this app. Additionally, provides a –2 to all noise within (Device Rating x5) meters of the device running the app.

# Junk Wall
Junk Wall takes layers of benign “junk code” and adds them to the network and any other linked devices’ firewalls. In order to access linked devices, an enemy hacker must get through the additional layers.  
**Rules:** Add one-half of the M-TOC’s Device Rating (round up) to a linked cyberjack or RCC’s Firewall rating.

# Mobile Medic
Designed to work directly with a medkit, giving the user additional information or instruction when treating wounded. The app constantly updates with the latest emergency medical data, so if someone doesn’t know how to administer aid, this app will guide them.  
**Rules:** Add half the Device Rating to the user’s First Aid dice pool, or add +1 to a medkit’s rating.

# Sneak-Sneak
Using a combination of tracking algorithms and image evaluation software, Sneak-Sneak helps the user increase their stealth by pointing out potential hazards or obstacles that could alert an enemy to their presence and suggests alternate paths/methods.  
**Rules:** Grants a +2 on all Stealth (Sneaking) tests.

# Team Leader
Leading a combat team during combat is a difficult and often chaotic situation. The Team Leader app presents the designated leader with data projections on current tactical situations based on sensor data, team biometrics, weapon status, and other environmental factors in order to assist with decision-making and team coordination.  
**Rules:** This app provides a pool of bonus dice equal to the M-TOC’s device rating for use on the following tests: teamwork, navigation, perception, and maneuver. This dice pool can be broken up and assigned as needed but can only be used once per combat engagement.

# Target Artist
Designed to work in conjunction with the Artillery Barrage app, Target Artist is used when a shooter doesn’t have line of sight on their target or when a target is behind cover/concealment but still needs to be engaged. This app takes targeting data from a source that has line of sight (another team member or drone for example) and paints the target or target area for the shooter, allowing them to attempt the shot. This app also has a secondary feature in that it can be used to rapidly identify and designate targets, obstacles, or hazards on a mapsoft overlay.  
**Rules:** Allows shooter to attack without direct line of sight. Designated targets then can be targeted with the “called shot” action as an anytime action.

# SHARP COMBAT

Surviving as a shadowrunner means always getting better. There is no such thing as “good enough”—you’re either improving or in danger of being taken out. Lawman and gunfighter Jack Helm gets shot and killed by John Wesley Hardin, who gets ambushed by gunslinger Old John Selman, who gets killed by US Marshal George Scarborough, who dies in a gunfight with outlaws. They all thought they were on the top of the heap, right until someone pulled them down to the grave. The next bullet is waiting for you—someone out there is loading it into their gun and planning how to get it past whatever defenses you think you have.

There are no guaranteed ways to stay alive, but there are ways to push the odds to be slightly more in your favor. Whether it’s exploiting the advantage you’ve built up in the course of an encounter or studying and employing new combat techniques, here are some ways to stay sharp in the shadows and keep one step ahead of the opposition.

## NEW EDGE ACTIONS

These actions supplement the Edge Actions on p. 47, *SR6*.

### BLINDING STRIKE  
*(Any Attack, Blind)*

This special attack goes after the eyes of opponents. This can be as direct as an eye gouge or indirect, like cutting the face near the eyes so that blood impedes vision. If net hits on an attack roll are higher than the Agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Blind I status. This status adds more levels of Blind if the opponent already had that status. Duration of the inflicted status is a number of combat rounds equal the net hits on the attack. No other damage occurs from the attack.  
Cost: 4 Edge


---


# Called Shot: Break Weapon  
*(Any Attack)*  
If you can’t disarm your opponent, or you just want to show off, you can direct your attack against your opponent’s weapon to disable it. The Attack roll is similar to breaking through barriers (p. 111, SR6). If the modified DV exceeds half of the Structure rating for the weapon (see Weapon Structure Ratings table) corresponding to the weapon, the Attack Rating of the weapon is reduced by 1 permanently in all range categories. If the DV exceeds the Structure rating, reduce the Attack Rating by the difference between DV and the Structure rating. If the Attack Rating is reduced to 0 in a range category, the weapon cannot be used at that distance (p. 109, SR6). If there is no Attack Rating available in any range category, it’s time to buy a new one, as this one’s busted. Cost: 5 Edge

# Called Shot: Incapacitate  
*(Any Attack)*  
If you can’t take your opponent in a fair fight, try inflicting a concussion first. With this called shot, if the number of net hits exceeds the Reaction attribute of the target, that character receives the Dazed status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to the net hits. Cost: 5 Edge

# Charge  
*(Melee Attack, Move Action)*  
You throw yourself body and soul into the attack, hoping to bring both the pain and some staggering power. After moving at least 5 meters, you make the attack against your opponent. Net hits can be transferred from damage to movement; for each point transferred, the damage is reduced by one, and the opponent is moved one meter. The attacker can transfer damage in an amount equal to or less than their Body rating. If the attack damages the opponent, calculate the possibility of knocking the opponent prone as if the damage value was 2 higher than it was after the transfer. Cost: 4 Edge

# Cover Fire  
*(BF or FA Attack)*  
To put it simply, you spray a whole lot of bullets in the direction of your opponent to put them in an inconvenient position that your allies take advantage of as a kind of Cover. Your firearm must be firing in Burst Fire or Full Auto mode. When using Burst Fire, instead of increasing the DV of the weapon by 1 against the two opponents, you give two allies a +2 to Cover (up to Cover IV) if the targeted opponents retaliate. With Full Auto, reduce the DV of the weapon by 2 and your allies receive Cover IV in relation to opponents that are targeted. Cost: 3 Edge

# Entanglement  
*(Grapple Attack with Exotic Weapon)*  
Exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats have the capabilities of entangling an opponent. When used as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If net hits of the attack exceed the opponent’s Agility, the weapon has entangled the opponent, and they gain the Hobbled status for a number of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits. Cost: 3 Edge

# Fake Out  
*(Any Attack)*  
Your strategy in this attack is not to kill or maim, but to distract, putting your opponent off balance or giving them a false feeling of success that puts them at a disadvantage when they take the bait. Roll an attack against the opponent. Instead of doing damage, net hits lower the opponent’s Defense Rating for the next combat round on a one-to-one basis (the weapon’s DV has no effect). This new Defense Rating is used by any attacker targeting this individual. Cost: 2 Edge

# Freerunning  
*(Sprint)*  
Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character can move quickly through and up terrain obstacles. This Edge Action allows both horizontal and vertical movement in one Major Action (instead of multiple Minor Actions). While sprinting, the character can remove hits from the Sprint action and use them to gain vertical distance (climbing both up and down), up to their Agility in meters. Movement with Parkour must end on a horizontal surface (or foothold/handhold), otherwise you fall down. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to ascend or descend vertically and if there’s a foothold or handhold. An adept with Wall Running ability who uses the Freerunning Action increases their base Sprint distance to 18 meters. Cost: 2 Edge

# Hamstring  
*(Any Attack)*  
This action covers any attack aimed at the hamstring, knee, or other parts of the leg with the express purpose of slowing down an opponent. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility


---


of the opponent, the opponent gains the Hobbled status with a duration of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack. Cost: 3 Edge

**IMPOSING STONE**  
*(Intercept)*  
Imposing Stone allows the character not only to intercept the opponent, but to prevent them from moving past them. Each success reduces the opponent’s movement by 1 meter. If the attack exceeds the opponent’s Agility, then the opponent stops next to the character. Cost: 2 Edge

**INTIMIDATING PRESENCE**  
*(Use Skill (Influence))*  
Sometimes, you just want to stand tall, flex some muscles, and speak in a commanding voice instead of having to shiv another round of gangers in the gut. Intimidating Presence can let punks know that you’re not to be messed with. To use it, a character rolls Influence + Strength vs. Willpower + Strength; net hits reduce opponents’ Attack Rating for that combat round on a one-to-one basis. If net hits exceed the opponent’s Attack Rating value, then the opponent cannot gain or spend Edge for the entire subsequent combat round. Cost: 2 Edge

**KARMIC ESCAPE**  
*(Dodge)*  
It’s not the incoming damage that’s worrying. It’s what it can do to your DocWagon premium. To use this action, characters must have attempted to dodge or block an attack that could inflict a status (Blind, Deafened, etc.) and failed. The character can then spend Edge and a Minor Action to attempt to avoid the status they would have received, at the cost of taking damage. Resolve the attack as if the net hits did damage rather than inflicting the status. Cost: 2 Edge

**KNUCKLE BREAKER**  
*(Any Attack)*  
As the name suggests, the attack is designed to neutralize the opponent’s effectiveness in combat or ability to escape. Character targets a specific limb (left leg, right arm, etc.). This called shot has a –4 dice pool penalty. If the attack is successful, that limb takes on Disabled status (see p. 106). If the net hits exceed the Body of the opponent, the limb takes on Disabled II status. The status lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. This attack can be repeated on the same limb to increase the Disabled status level (up to Disabled III). With every attack, the duration is cumulative. Cost: 4 Edge

**LEAF ON THE WIND**  
*(Sprint)*  
Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character takes advantage of the surrounding terrain, doing things like moving to give a smaller or obscured profile to attack, sliding through railings, flipping over benches, getting hang time off a room corner, or whatever other creative move they can come up with. While sprinting, the character can remove successes from the Sprint action and use them as cover, up to a status of Cover IV, lasting one combat round. Treat additional actions as if they performed in Cover, including gaining and using Edge. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to gain the Cover status. The Wall Running adept ability gives Cover I status automatically when using this action, as no one expects you to run up the freaking wall to escape. Cost: 3 Edge

**MONKEY CLIMB**  
*(Climb)*  
You are not one to keep your feet on the ground. There’s a missing bit of fear as you cross empty air, going from handhold to handhold, barely looking to see if you’re arriving anywhere safe. Change climb distance to 1.2 meters per hit (characters with Long Reach increase the distance to 1.3 meters). Cost: 2 Edge

**PIN**  
*(Thrown Weapon or Projectile Weapon Attack)*  
You’ve probably seen an action scene where a target is pinned to the wall with an arrow or knife or something to immobilize an opponent. This isn’t easy, in part because it’s more instinctive to aim for vital areas. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless if whether attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status. Cost: 3 Edge

**PLAYING POSSUM**  
*(Use Skill (Influence))*  
You are not quite dead yet, but you want to bluff your opponent into thinking you are done

**SHARP COMBAT // NEW EDGE ACTIONS**


---


for or are more injured than you actually are. The character rolls Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition. The gamemaster may include a dice pool adjustment for the believability of the particular circumstances. If successful, the character gains a dice pool bonus equal to net hits for the next attack against the opponent. If the character fails to bluff their opponent, the opponent gains a dice pool bonus equal to their net hits on their defense test. The gamemaster can wait to reveal whether the Playing Possum action succeeded or failed until the subsequent attack is made. Cost: 3 Edge

## Protect the Principal  
_(Intercept)_  
Self-sacrifice is sometimes necessary in getting the job done. If you can move to an ally in 1 Minor Action, then you take the damage from the opponent instead of the ally. There is no option to block or dodge this attack. Cost: 2 Edge

## Right Back At Ya!  
_(Avoid Incoming)_  
In an almost insane attempt at survival, this action has you grabbing a live grenade and trying to throw it away. Avoid Incoming puts you at ground zero of the grenade attack. You then spend a Pickup action and roll Athletics + Reaction (2) to attempt to knock the grenade away. Net hits are subtracted from scatter distance of the original throw as you attempt to send it back where it came from. The gamemaster then re-rolls the scatter direction. Cost: 3 Edge

## Riposte  
_(Block)_  
This action allows the character to not only attempt to block an attack but possibly give a little damage back. First, the expenditure of Edge allows the character to decrease the base damage by 2P. If their Defense test is successful, the attacker is hit with damage equal to the net hits on the Defense test. Cost: 4 Edge

## Rolling Clouds  
_(Falling)_  
If you’re lucky enough (relatively speaking) to fall next to terrain such as a wall, cliff, or trees that you can reach, you may attempt to leverage kinetic forces to slow down your fall to something less than terminal. With an Athletics + Agility test, each success extends the number of meters that you can fall without suffering damage. For example, if you fall 15 meters and roll 3 hits, you get the base 3 meters of safe falling plus 3 more safe meters from Rolling Clouds, meaning the damaging part of your fall is 9 meters, making the damage 4P instead of 6P. Cost: 2 Edge

## Rooted  
_(Move)_  
When someone tries to knock you down, you have the quick sense to adjust your center of gravity to cancel out the force that’s knocking you to the ground. The character rolls Agility + Athletics and adds their hits to their Body rating for purposes of checking if they are knocked down (p. 110, SR6) or against a Trip or Tumble (p. 43, SR6). Cost: 2 Edge

## Sucker Punch  
_(Any Melee Attack, Fatigued)_  
This is all about playing outside Queensbury rules, unleashing a sucker punch to get that first hit in before the opponent is ready, or some other form of dirty fighting. With the attack roll, if net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Fatigued status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. No damage occurs from the attack. Cost: 2 Edge

## Taunt  
_(Use Skill (Influence))_  
Someone is always going to pick on the mage first. There are even slogans about it. If it’s your mage, then you need to get the pressure off them. One option is to suggest that the opponent pick on someone their own size. A successful taunt will get into the opponent’s head and distract them from beating said mage, or goad them into some other action. A character can taunt an opponent with Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition test. Net hits increase the Defense Rating of the ally against that opponent for one combat round. Cost: 1 Edge

## Threatening Edge  
_(Block)_  
The fast-spinning whirl of a staff, the flash of a half-meter of shiny metal, even the sound of a massive object moving through the air, knowing that it can easily crush bones, can be psychologically intimidating even for those not close by or holding a gun. No one wants to be the next target. The character includes a weapon performance as part of combat, giving opponents something to think about. For the duration of the encounter, while


---


wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon. Cost: 1 Edge

# Throat Strike  
_(Any Melee Attack)_  
A good strike when you just want your opponent to shut the hell up with the descriptive expletives and just fight. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Muted status (p. 106). Duration of the inflicted status is equal the number of net hits in combat rounds. No damage occurs from the attack. Cost: 2 Edge

# Throw Person  
_(Grapple)_  
Once the opponent has been grappled, the attacker may pick up the opponent. The attacker makes a Close Combat + Strength vs. Strength + Reaction test. The attacker’s unarmed Attack Rating is used, and the defender suffers the –4 dice pool penalty for being restrained. If the attack is successful, the attacker inflicts their unarmed combat damage (Strength/2, rounded up) plus net hits. The character can remove successes from the combat damage and use them for distance thrown, up to Strength/2 meters. After the throw, the opponent is out of the grapple and gains the Prone status. The gamemaster can impose additional damage to the thrown character based on where they land (onto a bed of nails, out a window of a skyscraper, down an elevator shaft, etc.). Cost: 4 Edge

# Thunder Palm  
_(Any Attack)_  
A quick strike to the ears, and the opponent will be left unable to hear that awesome retort you just came up with. If net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Deafened status with a duration of a number of Combat Rounds equal the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack. Cost: 2 Edge

# Tuck and Roll  
_(Character Receives the Prone Status)_  
You’re already going down from some attack (any attack that ended with the character prone), so you might as well hit the ground on your own terms. You may move up to 1 meter from the original location where you were going to be lying (which may put you at a different range category from the opponent or closer to cover). You are still prone, and the Prone status still applies. Cost: 1 Edge

# Weapon Flash  
_(Quick Draw, Attack)_  
This Edge Action allows the Quick Draw Action to be applied to any melee weapon. The Attack Action must be used in conjunction with this action. Cost: 2 Edge

# Weapon Spread  
For the duration of the encounter, while wielding two melee weapons, Close range is extended by 2 meters. Cost: 1 Edge

# Yielding Force  
_(Trip)_  
Instead of using force to counter force, you attempt to leverage the force and momentum of the attacker and knock them off balance. Instead of blocking the attack, the defender bends out of the way, throwing the opponent off balance—and hopefully on the ground. Character rolls Athletics + Agility as the defense test against the attack. If net hits exceed the Agility of the opponent, then the character takes no damage, and the opponent receives the Prone status. Otherwise, resolve as if the character was dodging. Cost: 3 Edge

# New Edge Boosts  
This new use of Edge helps deal with the different statuses a character receives that may slow them down as they run the shadows.

## 4-Edge Boost  
### I Saw It in a Trid Once (I)  
A character may use any martial arts technique they haven’t spent Karma to learn as part of their next action. This use of Edge may not have its cost reduced by martial arts techniques the user has already spent Karma to learn.

## 5-Edge Boost  
### Recover (A)  
You spend a Major Action to recover from one debilitating status effect during this encounter or reduce the effect by 1 if it has multiple levels.

# Martial Arts  
For as long as one metahuman has had beef with another metahuman, we’ve been looking for more effective ways to beat the hell out of each

> Other, whether with blunt objects, sharp objects, or our bare hands—and thus, martial arts were born. In the earliest years of their development, the martial arts had a very Darwinian progression: If they were ineffective, the user died, leaving only the best techniques and styles to be passed on. The introduction of firearms to war, and the resulting ability of minimally trained gunners to mow down skilled melee fighters with relatively little risk to themselves, relegated most martial arts styles to pastime status—until the Sixth World came around.  
> The emergence of cybernetically enhanced fighters who could react fast enough to dodge bullets, mystical warriors who could sense danger and avoid it before it landed, and metahumans who were simply too tough for bullets to do much of anything to them sparked a resurgence in the martial arts as practical exercises. (Naturally, the early initiatives by the Japanacorps to promote “samurai culture” had their own effects, too, as did the response from other cultures who vehemently argued that *their* martial arts were just as good as Japan’s.) Shadowrunners, ever pragmatic, appreciated the value in weapons that were both utterly silent and didn’t require ammunition. Nowadays, any runner who expects to get into combat (or in other words, any runner) would do well to learn a little about the fighting arts.

# Martial Arts Rules

Acquiring a martial art happens during character creation or advancement; styles are purchased with Karma, much as qualities are. The costs are listed in the *Learning Martial Arts* table.

Each martial art is associated with one or more categories of techniques. When a character first learns a martial art, they receive the signature technique for free. The remaining techniques from the categories associated with the style may be learned separately. Techniques that are listed in the General category (see the table on p. 106) may be learned by practitioners of any style, and certain techniques may have additional restrictions on their use (such as Meridian Strike, which requires the user to possess a certain adept power). Unless stated otherwise in the technique’s description, Grappling and Striking techniques may only be used unarmed, and Weapon techniques may only be used with weapons. For the purposes of martial arts techniques, fist-loaded weapons such as knucks (p. 249, *SR6*) and shock gloves (p. 250, *SR6*) count as an unarmed attack, not a weapon attack.

There are no limits on how many styles a character may learn, provided they can find either a teacher or suitable reference material (exactly what’s considered “suitable reference material” is up to the gamemaster’s discretion). Each technique may only be learned once, unless noted otherwise in that technique’s description; a character who learns the Joint Lock technique while studying Close Quarters Combat wouldn’t be able to learn the technique a second time by going on to study Jujutsu.

# Traditional Martial Arts

A sampling of the styles Sixth World fighters use to batter each other around is included below.

## 52 Blocks

Known by a wide variety of other names, 52 Blocks evolved from fighting styles practiced by African American slaves and was further developed by inmates in American prison systems throughout the twentieth century. The style is highly defensive and mobile, highlighted by the “52 blocks” that give it its name, while also incorporating striking and knife techniques.

*Category:* Mobility, Striking  
*Signature Technique:* Elbows In

# AIKIDO
Widely known as the “pacifist’s martial art,” aikido is a “soft” martial art that relies on using the opponent’s force against them. The techniques are almost purely defensive, emphasizing disarming and restraining attackers without inflicting harm. Aikido also possesses a strong spiritual element, combining traditional Buddhist and Shinto beliefs with a philosophy of peace and non-violence.

# ARNIS
An umbrella term for a collection of Filipino martial arts, arnis (also known as *arnis de mano*, *escrima*, or *kali*) emphasizes the use of paired rattan sticks (*baston*) or daggers (*baraw/daga*), as well as longer blunt and bladed weapons, unarmed strikes, and joint locks.

# BARTITSU
Known as the “gentleman’s martial art” and made famous by literary heroes like Sherlock Holmes and John Steed, bartitsu teaches the use of a cane or umbrella—back in the day, those were objects people might carry on an everyday basis—as a self-defense tool.

# BOXING
Ah, good ol’ fisticuffs. Boxing is the ancient art of punching someone until they fall over, hopefully before they punch you until *you* fall over. The styles of individual boxers vary greatly—some are highly mobile and throw flurries of punches, while others focus on taking punishment until they can knock their opponent out in a single blow. The chief difference is that unlike other styles of unarmed combat, boxing relies on fists alone.

# CAPOEIRA
Developed in Amazonia (then known as Brazil) by slaves of African heritage, capoeira has practitioners who avoid detection by disguising their art as a dance. Since the practitioners’ hands were often shackled, preventing them from attacking or defending effectively with their arms, capoeira emphasizes highly evasive movements and leg techniques like kicks and sweeping the legs.

# CHAKRAM FIGHTING
The chakram is originally a throwing weapon from the Indian subcontinent, though it was widely used across various parts of Asia. It typically takes the form of a sharpened ring that can be worn as jewelry until it was needed in combat. The chakram can also be worn as a sharpened knuckle-duster, provided the user is willing to risk cutting their own hand.

# CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT/COMBATIVES
“Combatives” is a general description for practically focused, “tactical” martial arts developed for use by law enforcement and military personnel, rather than traditional styles carried into the present day. They often include a mix of grappling and striking techniques, including baton techniques, disarming opponents with weapons, and methods of using firearms in hand-to-hand combat.

# EUROPEAN FENCING (LONGSWORD)
One of many weapons flying the banner of “historical European martial arts,” the longsword is the archetypal two-handed sword used throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. Its resurgence in the Sixth World came about thanks to the re-discovery of manuals by masters like Fiore dei Liberi and Johannes Lichentauer, which gained special traction among street samurai who disdain the katana as being over-hyped. Originally developed for the battlefield, longsword fencing is perfect for those who intend to cut through swathes of opponents in a single swing.

*Signature Technique:* Half-Sword  

# EUROPEAN FENCING (RAPIER/SABER)
This is not modern sport fencing, but rather combat in the style of Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault, Agrippa, and that one classic flatvid duel

SHADOWRUN: FIRING SQUAD

MARTIAL ARTS // SHARP COMBAT

from the 1980s. Most twenty-first-century fencing is based on techniques that originated in France and Italy, although the Spanish style of *la verdadera destreza* has gained quite a bit of traction in recent years. European duelists often paired their rapiers with an off-hand weapon like a dagger, a tradition that’s survived into the modern day.  
*Category:* Weapon  
*Signature Technique:* Ballestra  

## Jeet Kune Do/ Mixed Martial Arts  
The style of Jeet Kune Do was first developed by the legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, combining elements of many existing martial arts styles under a philosophy of “whatever works”—the same philosophy applied by practitioners of mixed martial arts, who often study both grappling and striking styles (jujutsu and Muay Thai is a popular combination) to ensure their effectiveness in the ring.  
*Similar Styles:* Hapkido (Korea)  
*Categories:* Grappling, Striking  
*Signature Technique:* Sweep the Leg  

## Jogo do Pao  
Developed in Portugal, Jogo do Pao is effectively staff fighting. It evolved from the techniques that residents of rural areas used to fend off dangerous wildlife with long walking sticks. Its popularity fell as time passed and more people moved into the city, but it maintained enough of a following to survive into the Sixth World.  
*Similar Styles:* Ball de bastons (Iberian peninsula), canne de combat (France)  
*Category:* Weapon  
*Signature Technique:* Threatening Edge  

## Jujutsu  
Jujutsu (and its combat-sport variant, judo) is an unarmed combat style from Japan that focuses heavily on grappling, restraining/subduing, and throwing techniques. It’s frequently studied by police officers for the purposes of disarming and arresting suspects, and by bouncers for escorting unruly customers off the premises.  
*Similar Styles:* Malla-yuddha (India), sambo (Russia), shuai jiao (China)  
*Categories:* Grappling  
*Signature Technique:* Joint Lock  

## Karate  
One of the first Asian martial arts introduced to the Western world, karate originates from Okinawa and focuses primarily on striking, with particular emphasis on the fists and other parts of the hand (“karate” translates as “empty hand”). Kicking techniques are relatively common in karate, while grappling and weapon use is more rare.  
*Similar Styles:* Tang Soo Do (Korea)  
*Category:* Striking  
*Signature Technique:* Tameshiwari  

## Kenjutsu  
A term well-known to both street samurai and anyone within earshot of a Japanese culture enthusiast, kenjutsu is the art of fighting with the Japanese sword. It’s strongly associated with the katana, but most kenjutsu styles also include techniques for using the kodachi/wakizashi (short swords) and tanto (dagger), as well as the related art of battojutsu/iaijutsu (the art of drawing the sword and attacking in the same motion). The sport form, kendo, is widely popular in Japan.

*Categories:* Weapon  
*Signature Technique:* Iaijutsu  

## Kickboxing  
As one might guess from the name, kickboxing is boxing with the addition of feet—and often elbows, knees, and other body parts, including the head. Much like its hands-only cousin, kickboxing relies almost exclusively on striking, with relatively little in the way of grappling or weapons techniques (though many kickboxing styles have companion arts focusing on the use of weapons).  
*Similar Styles:* Lethwei (Myanmar), Muay Boran/Muay Thai (Thailand), Muay Lao (Laos), Musti-yuddha (India), Pradal Serey (Cambodia), sanshou (China)

## Kung Fu  
More properly a group of related martial arts styles, the term “kung fu” usually applies to the “external” or “hard” styles characterized by dynamic, physically strenuous techniques with a heavy emphasis on striking. Popular examples of kung fu styles include the Five Animals style, the Shaolin styles, Wing Chun, and wushu.

## Kung Fu (Eighteen Weapons)  
Historically, many styles of martial arts integrated the study of weapons into the same curriculum as unarmed techniques. In China, the four main martial arts weapons were the spear (*qiang*), staff (*gun*), saber (*dao*), and straight sword (*jian*),

## KYUJUTSU  
Kyujutsu is a Japanese form of archery using an unusually long bow called a *yumi*, the largest of which were sometimes taller than their wielders. Originally practiced by the samurai, kyujutsu fell out of mainstream use with the introduction of firearms, but it has regained popularity in the Sixth World for both cultural and practical reasons.  
*Similar Styles:* Turkish archery (Turkey)

## NINJUTSU  
Though widely known in popular culture as assassins, ninja were historically infiltrators and spies. In contrast to the samurai (and much like shadowrunners), ninjas were willing to employ any number of “dishonorable” techniques to win battles and achieve their objectives. Stealth and quickly disabling opponents were key tenets of ninjutsu (sometimes known as *taijutsu*). Ninja combat arts also included many weapons techniques, most notably the use of the shuriken.  
*Categories:* Mobility, Striking  
*Signature Technique:* Dim Mak  

## OKICHITAW  
Originating with the Plains Cree of North America, Okichitaw is one of the few indigenous North American fighting styles to have survived into the Sixth World. The style is highly aggressive and focuses on neutralizing opponents with rapid takedowns. The primary weapon used in Okichitaw is the gunstock war club, though the style also incorporates the tomahawk and dagger.  
*Categories:* Grappling, Ranged  
*Signature Technique:* Close-Quarter Firearms (Longarms)  

## PARKOUR  
Not strictly a martial art, parkour was developed as a form of quick and effective movement through dense urban environments. Many of the techniques used in parkour can be adapted to martial arts practice, whether to gain a tactical advantage over an opponent or just run the hell away from a fight you shouldn’t have picked.  
*Categories:* Mobility  
*Signature Technique:* Rolling Clouds  

## TAE KWON DO  
Like its Japanese counterpart, karate, tae kwon do was synthesized from indigenous Korean fighting styles and external styles of kung fu imported from China. Tae kwon do is famous for its flashy high and spinning kicks, often complimented with rapid hand strikes, and continues to be one of the most popular combat sports in Korea.  
*Similar Styles:* Savate (France)  
*Categories:* Striking  
*Signature Technique:* Flying Kick  

## THE COWBOY WAY  
Popularized by flatvids set in the American West, the art now referred to as the Cowboy Way—using the lasso to entangle enemies at range—arguably has its origins with the Huns and other nomadic cultures of central Asia. The additions of fisticuffs, gun-twirling, and ten-gallon hats are almost certainly American innovations. Given the similarities of the weapons, many of the techniques used in the Cowboy Way can also be applied to  
*Similar Styles:* Latigo y daga (Philippines), nawajutsu (Japan), whip fighting  
*Category:* Weapon  
*Signature Technique:* Entanglement  

## WRESTLING  
Although “wrestling” is an extremely broad category (in much the same way as “kung fu”), in a general sense, wrestling consists of grabbing a part of your opponent’s body (or an item of clothing), then bending it into a pretzel or pinning them to the ground until they beg you to stop. In some cases, like in Japanese sumo, it’s possible to win matches by pushing the opponent out of the ring.

*Signature Technique:* Sacrifice Throw  

# SIXTH WORLD MARTIAL ARTS  
Developing new ways to hit each other with fists, sticks, and sharp objects didn’t stop just because people started growing horns or shooting lightning from their fingers. The Sixth World has spawned its own crop of new combat techniques, many of which have made their way into the shadows.  

## CARROMELEG  
The much-celebrated elven martial art relies on quick, accurate strikes (both unarmed and with various bladed weapons) and highly mobile defenses, often leading to the claim that there are “no  


---


stances” in carromeleg. Claims that the style was actually developed in a previous age of the world continue to swirl, and traditionally minded carromeleg instructors will only accept elves as students—but a handful of carromeleg masters have begun sharing their style with non-elves, leading to a great deal of friction within the carromeleg community (such as it is).

**Techniques:** Bending of the Reed (Melee)  

## Gun Kata/Gun Fu  
More of a performance art than a combat art in its twentieth-century flatvid incarnations, Gun Kata (also known as Gun Fu) has taken on a new practicality in an era of supernaturally and technologically enhanced reflexes and aim. The style focuses on the use of the pistol as both a melee and ranged weapon, and many Gun Kata practitioners modify their guns to increase their sturdiness in melee (and disable the annoying warnings from their smartlinks about improper shooting posture). Gun Kata retains some of the flashiness of its showbiz origins, and Gun Kata stylists have been known to incorporate both acrobatics and trick shots into their fighting style.

**Signature Technique:** Close-Quarters Firearms (Handguns)  

## Hapsum-Do  
Though adepts practice a wide variety of martial arts styles with fearsome effectiveness, hapsum-do (or the Way of Unified Mana) is the first martial arts style developed specifically to make use of an adept’s supernatural powers. Grandmaster “Barghest” Knorr, an adept who travels around the world to share his techniques, is widely acknowledged as the founder of the style. Functionally similar to other “hybrid” arts that include both grappling and striking techniques (and thus usable by non-adepts in many respects), certain hapsum-do techniques rely on the practitioners’ Awakened abilities to be effective.  
**Categories:** Grappling, Striking  
**Signature Technique:** Meridian Strike  

## Knight Errant Tactical and Lone Star Tactical  
These two combat systems, developed by the law-enforcement corps whose names they bear, are essentially Sixth World spins on the CQC combatives of the twentieth century. Practitioners of either style would swear that *their* approach was completely different than the *other* guys. At the end of the day, though, both Knight Errant and Lone Star deal with basically the same situations in the course of their duties, and each corp’s approach to dealing with those situations is fundamentally similar. The primary difference between the two styles is that Knight Errant places more emphasis on disarming individual attackers (you never know when they might be a SINner who can file a complaint and cause a PR headache), while Lone Star focuses on crowd control.

**Signature Techniques:** Multiple Opponent Combat (Lone Star Tactical) / Releasing Talons (Knight Errant Tactical)  

## Oni-ryu Taijutsu  
The Oni Do Kai is a group of Yakuza “ninja” (freelance operatives) composed almost entirely of orks and trolls. Early on, Oni Do Kai members recognized that their imposing size and strength would put them at a disadvantage in the same country that produced judo and jujutsu, and they began modifying their style of ninjutsu to turn those weaknesses into strengths—and thus, Oni-ryu taijutsu was born. Nobody’s quite sure why the Oni Do Kai decided to share their techniques with outsiders, but that hasn’t stopped orks and trolls around Japan (and in other countries with large Japanese communities) from signing up for classes in droves. After the Oni Do Kai went semi-public, other tusker-focused martial arts groups with their own styles (under names like Trog Kwan Do and Tuskrima, among others) followed suit, and the community is growing rapidly.

## Sangre y Acero  
After the invention of functional cybernetic limbs in the 2030s, it was only a matter of time before someone designed cyberlimbs that were optimized for combat. Originating in the gladiator pits of Tenochtitlán, Sangre y Acero (also known as Etzilitzli and Ars Cybernetica) makes the best possible use of the advantages granted by cyberlimbs, especially against other melee weapons.  
**Categories:** Striking, Weapon  
**Signature Technique:** Iron Limbs  

## Wildcat  
When the Sioux Wildcats finally lifted their ban on cybernetics in unit members in 2080, it was anyone’s guess whether their in-house martial art would flourish or suffer because of it. The jury’s still out, but the style—a blend of Okichitaw, aikido, karate, and Muay Thai that focuses on disabling opponents as quickly as possible—is as effective as ever, particularly against non-augmented opponents (like the Wildcats’ arch-rivals, the Tír Ghosts).

# A NOTE ON CALLED SHOTS

> **Clarification:** The Called Shots listed on pp. 47-48 of that book may be made either by taking a –4 penalty to your roll, or spending Edge to attempt the Called Shot without a dice pool penalty.

# MARTIAL ART TECHNIQUES

## BALLESTRA  
Reduce the Edge cost for the Shank Edge Action by 1.  
**Category:** Weapon; may only be used with bladed weapons

## BATON LOCK  
In the hands of a trained fighter, sticks of various lengths can be used as grappling aids. When using a blunt weapon, you may use any technique from the Grappling category as though you were unarmed, with the option of using the weapon’s damage (including the bonus from Precision Strikes, if applicable) in place of your base unarmed damage.  
**Category:** Weapon

## BENDING OF THE REED  
Gain a bonus Edge when using the Dodge Minor Action against melee *or* ranged attacks (choose which category when learning this technique). This technique may be taken up to twice in order to gain both the melee and the ranged Dodge bonus.  
**Category:** Mobility

## CLOSE-QUARTERS FIREARMS (HANDGUNS)  
When using a light pistol, heavy pistol, holdout pistol, machine pistol, or taser in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.  
**Category:** Ranged

## CLOSE-QUARTERS FIREARMS  
When using a rifle, shotgun, or submachine gun in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.  
**Category:** Ranged

## DEFIANT DANCE  
When caught in a Grapple (p. 111, *SR6*), the character may roll Athletics + Agility as though they were escaping from restraints in place of their normal Close Combat + Strength, using the opponent’s net hits on the opposed Strength Test to initiate the grapple as the threshold for the Escape test.  
**Category:** Mobility

## DIM MAK  
By making a Called Shot to target a specific limb, on a successful attack you may choose to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the selected limb instead of inflicting damage, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1.  
**Category:** Striking

## DRUNKEN BOXING  
You’ve been trained to move and attack in unpredictable ways, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. The number of 1s you need to glitch on any Unarmed attack is reduced by 1 due to the sloppy execution, but your target loses two dice from their Defense Tests against those attacks thanks to the difficulty in anticipating your movements.  
**Category:** Mobility

## ELBOWS TIGHT  
Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action without a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.  
**Category:** Mobility

## END THEM RIGHTLY  
When using a melee weapon, you may apply the bonus granted by the Feint Maneuver to an attack with a throwing weapon instead of a melee weapon. If the throwing weapon is fitted to the melee weapon as a weapon attachment, you may detach and throw it without spending a Ready Weapon Minor Action to draw the thrown weapon.  
**Category:** Weapon

## ENTANGLEMENT  
This functions the same as the Edge Action (p. 93) but without the Edge cost. When using exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If successful, not only is the opponent restrained, but with a Minor Action, the weapon now restrains the opponent, leaving the attacker free to do other things. If net hits of the attack exceed the opponent’s Agility, the opponent gains the Hobbled status for a number of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits.  
**Category:** Weapon


---


# Feint  
By spending a Minor Action and succeeding at a Close Combat + Agility (3) test, you may reduce your target’s Defense test dice pool against your next Close Combat attack by 3 dice. **Category:** General

# Flying Kick  
You’ve trained yourself to become a metahuman projectile, battering opponents down with your soaring feet of fury. By spending an extra Minor Action and succeeding at an Athletics + Agility (3) test, you may extend your Close range bracket by 0.5 meters/hit (not net hit) and increase your DV by 2 (stacking with the bonus from Kick Attack, for a total bonus of +3). However, a glitch on either the Athletics + Agility test to launch yourself successfully or the Close Combat + Agility test for the attack roll results in gaining the Unbalanced status until your next action, and a critical glitch on either roll makes you take a tumble, inflicting both the Prone status and the Disabled II status (p. 106) on one of your legs (randomly determined) as you twist your joints in a way they weren’t intended to move. **Category:** Striking; requires the Kick Attack technique

# Ground Fighter  
You’re used to fights ending up as a mass of tangled limbs rolling around on the nearest flat surface. You never suffer penalties for attacking or defending while you have the Prone status (p. 53, *SR6*), and the penalty to your Defense tests while restrained is reduced by half (rounded down). **Category:** Grappling

# Half-Sword  
Increase the Attack Rating of the weapon by 2 when making Half-Sword attacks, but reduce the Close Range bracket by 1 meter. **Category:** Weapon; may only be used with swords

# Iaijutsu  
Like the samurai of old (or at least the ones in the trids), the character may use the Quick Draw Minor Action (p. 42, *SR6*) with any properly stored melee weapon that is small enough to be wielded in one hand—no quick-drawing polearms, unless it’s dwarf-sized and you’re a troll. The character must still use the Quick Draw action together with the Attack Major Action. **Category:** Weapon

# Iron Limbs  
Add +1 DV to your base unarmed damage. **Category:** Striking

# Jiao Di  
This probably wasn’t what your parents meant when they told you to “use your head,” but it works. You may use a head butt to make unarmed attacks at half your normal Close range increment even when your limbs are otherwise immobile, including while grappling or being grappled, and you gain +1 DV to those attacks (does not stack with Iron Limbs or Ti Khao). Also, when defending against a grapple, you may attempt to damage your opponent as though you were the attacker (p. 111, *SR6*). **Category:** Grappling

# Joint Lock  
When executing a grapple (p. 111, *SR6*), the character may use the “Inflict Damage” option to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the grappled arm or leg, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1. **Category:** Grappling

# Kick Attack  
You’ve been trained to use all sorts of kicks effectively in combat, whether they’re front kicks, side kicks, or even the legendary roundhouse kick (beard optional). When attacking with Kick Attack, add +1 to your unarmed Damage Value and 2 meters to your Close Range. Rolling a glitch on a Kick Attack inflicts the Off-Balance status on you, while rolling a critical glitch inflicts the Prone status. **Category:** Striking

# Mean Right Hook  
Reduce the Edge cost of the Knockout Blow Edge Action (p. 47, *SR6*) by 1. **Category:** Striking

# Meridian Strike  
By combining their Awakened talents with their martial arts expertise, adept practitioners of hapsum-do may disrupt the flow of mana in their opponent’s bodies. When making an unarmed attack against an Awakened opponent, if the adept has the Killing Hands power active, they may choose to reduce the dice pool for their target’s next Magic-linked test by 1 per net hit instead of inflicting damage. **Category:** Striking; requires Killing Hands

# Multiple Opponent Combat  
When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action to attack multiple targets, add 1 die to your attack pool for every two targets you attack. (For the purposes of this technique, attacking multiple locations on the same target counts as one target.) **Category:** Mobility

# Multiple Opponent Defense  
When you’re attacked by multiple attackers in


---


# Neijia

You might not be Awakened, but you’ve learned to channel your *qi* (or *ki, prana, ruach, pneuma*, “spirit energy,” or sheer meanness) into a strike that reaches across the boundaries between material and immaterial. You may make unarmed attacks against astral entities as though you were Awakened (see *Astral Combat*, p. 160, *SR6*), with a Damage Value of  
$$\text{(WILL/2 + net hits)}.$$  
This technique does not give you the ability to perceive astrally or bond weapon foci.  
**Category:** General

# Oaken Stance

Gain a bonus Edge when resisting attempts to knock you prone in melee combat. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.  
**Category:** Mobility

# Parry

Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action with a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.  
**Category:** Weapon

# Pin

This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless of whether the attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status.  
**Category:** Weapon; may only be used with sharp weapons.

# Precision Strikes

Thanks to extensive training with your chosen weapon, you may add (STR/3, rounded up) to the DV of your attacks when using weapons from the specified category. This technique may be taken multiple times, applying to a different category of weapon (Blades, Clubs, Exotic) each time it’s taken.  
**Category:** Weapon

# Releasing Talons

Reduce the Edge cost of the Wrest Edge Action (p. 47, *SR6*) by 1.  
**Categories:** Grappling, Striking

# Rolling Clouds

This works the same way as the Edge Action of the same name (p. 95), only without the Edge cost. With an Athletics + Agility test, each success extends the number of meters that you can fall without suffering damage.  
**Category:** Weapon

# Sacrifice Throw

“If I’m going down, I’m taking you with me!” If an attacker manages to knock you prone, you may immediately spend a Minor Action (if you have one) to attempt to knock them down as though you were tackling them (see *Grapple*, p. 111, *SR6*).  
**Category:** Grappling

# Striking the Darkness

When in melee combat in low-light conditions (see *Environment and Visibility*, p. 118, *SR6*), you are treated as having a vision enhancement for the purposes of gaining Edge.  
**Category:** General

# Sweep the Leg

When performing the Trip Minor Action while unarmed, you receive a free point of situational Edge that goes away if you do not use it on the Trip test.  
**Categories:** Grappling, Striking

# Tameshiwari

Boards might not hit back, but you never know when it’ll be useful to break through a solid surface with your hands, feet, head, or other part of your body. When attacking a barrier (including magical barriers that impede the user’s physical movement) with an unarmed attack, treat the barrier as if the Structure rating were 4 lower for the purposes of determining damage. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a glitch or critical glitch may result in the attacker breaking their own hand/foot/head on the offending object.  
**Category:** Striking

# Threatening Edge

This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. For the duration of an encounter, while wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon.  
**Category:** Weapon

# Ti Khao

You’ve been trained to use your knees to attack an opponent while grappling, whether by kneeling on them to choke them out or striking them for a bit of extra oomph. Add +1 DV to damage you inflict while grappling (see *Grapple*, p. 111, *SR6*).  
**Category:** Grappling


---


# Tricking

Flashy spinning kicks, twirling staves, and shooting the cigarette out of an opponent’s mouth might not be practical in the normal sense, but if done right, they can impress your friends and scare your enemies. Whenever you make a Teamwork test to help an ally intimidate a target, including using the Big Speech Edge Action (p. 47, SR6), you may roll Weapon Skill + Agility in place of Influence + Charisma. (When using this technique with the Big Speech Edge Action, only the first Influence + Charisma test may be replaced with Weapon Skill + Agility, not both.)  
**Category:** General

# Two-Weapon Fighting

When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action with more than one weapon, gain an additional two dice to split between your attacks.  
**Category:** Weapon.

# Weapon Breaker

When using Called Shot—Disarm, reduce either the Edge cost (if spending Edge) or the dice pool penalty (if not spending Edge) by 1.  
**Category:** General.

# New Statuses

These new statuses are used in this chapter.

## Disabled (I, II, III)

Muscles are strained, joints dislocated, or ligaments are sprained causing the limb to be difficult to move with ease. A disabled arm or leg makes actions and combat more difficult. Gamemaster and players should take note of which limb is disabled so as to use alternative actions such as using an off-hand to attack. The levels of this status function as follows:

* I: Minor Actions involving the affected limb (such as Move for legs or Reload for arms/hands) cost 2 Minor Actions instead of 1.
* II: Major Actions that use that limb (such as Sprint for legs, or most attacks for arms) now cost a Minor Action as well. This is in addition to effects of Disabled I.
* III: A Disabled leg at this level gives the character the Hobbled status. A Disabled arm inflicts a –4 penalty to skill tests using the arm. This is in addition to the effects of Disabled I & II.

## Muted

Subject has lost the ability to verbally communicate during the duration of the status. They retain the rest of their faculties in which they can attempt to communicate through (sign language, texting, panic button pressing, etc). The gamemaster has the final decision on whether this status prevents the use of some skills such as Influence.

## Off-Balance

Due to a bad step or uneven terrain, the character has trouble getting their feet under them. The character may not spend Edge on any action linked to a Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction, Strength) or on Defense Tests, and they are more likely to fall Prone as a result of rolling a glitch on one of those actions. This status persists until the character either spends a Minor Action to regain their balance or falls prone.

# THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS

**POSTED BY: FREYA**

Hello, my lovelies, and welcome to today’s episode of *Freya Tells You How to Live Your Life!* Yes, the JackPoint admins decided that I, She Who Puts the “Elf” in “Self-Centered” (or more generically, That Pointy-Eared Bitch) was just the right person to educate you all on the ins and outs of choosing to use violence: when it’s appropriate, how much to use, and so on.

> *I can answer that one: “Yes.”*  
> *Kane*  
> *Going ahead and locking replies to Kane’s comment. You can all have your “you’re wrong and my way is better” moments when Freya gets around to talking about specifics.*  
> *Bull*

Now, for some reason, the triumvirate seemed especially preoccupied with the social aspects of violence, like codes of honor and how people respond to violence being inflicted upon them. I’ll get to that, but let’s start with the topic at the center of it all: violence itself.

## WHAT IS VIOLENCE?

Contrary to popular belief, there are two different definitions of violence (and I’m not just saying that so I can tell you all you’re wrong later). What most people think of when they hear “violence” is something along the lines of “physical force applied in a manner intended to cause injury.” The expanded version, used mainly by law school students and cops looking for an excuse to bust people, broadens that from “applying” to “applying, attempting to apply, and/or threatening to apply” physical force. That’s the definition I’ll be using, because having to say “violence, including attempted or threatened violence” every time gets tedious.


---


> Useless trivia: Back in the day, “assault” originally meant “threatening or attempting to make unwanted physical contact with the intent to harm,” and “battery” was actually hitting someone. Over time, laws gradually changed to include “assault and battery” as people realized it was impossible to batter someone without assaulting them, and everyone just called it “assault” for short. Nowadays, most places define “assault” in the law as hitting someone (or the magical or Matrix equivalent), but a few jurisdictions still have “assault and battery”—which, yes, means you can be arrested just for taking a swing at someone, even if you don’t hit them. People who have a short temper and bad aim, consider yourselves warned.  
> DangerSensei

> Not to be confused with assault **with** battery, which is when you clock some drekhead for trying to feel you up while you’re working on your car’s engine.  
> Turbo Bunny

> Technically, that’d also be “battery with battery.”  
> DangerSensei

> Stop it.  
> Glitch

> What about stuff like Black Hammer? It’s not like you have to physically touch someone to cook their brain with biofeedback. Or a manabolt, since I’m sure Red or someone will bring that up.  
> /dev/grrl

> Good grrl, you’ve been paying attention.  
> Red

> A few people tried exactly that line in the courts way back in the ‘20s and ‘30s. The landmark case in the UCAS was **Collins v. California**, where the plaintiff argued that non-physical means of harming people should be considered “arms” (which the Supreme Court agreed with) and that any kind of limitations on them went against the Second Amendment (which they didn’t).  
> Kay St. Irregular

> Wait, the same woman that was on **The Battle Channel** the other week? The crazy gun lady who’s like, a hundred years old, and she’s been trying to get that ruling overturned for the last fifty years? Does she know California isn’t even part of the UCAS anymore?  
> Slamm-0!

> For some of us, “shall not be infringed” means **shall not be infringed, period.** Shame that being a Second Amendment activist in California is one of those cases of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.  
> Hard Exit

# Why Use Violence?

Now, this is where most people who write about the ethics of violence would say something like, “this isn’t intended to take a moral position on whether the use of violence is appropriate in any given circumstance.” I, however, am not most people. Answering moral questions about whether violence is appropriate “in any given circumstance” is the entire point of this section, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. I’ll even show you how to make your own moral judgments, for those situations when I’m not around to tell you the right answer. As the old saying goes, “Teach a man to judge, and you’ll make him insufferable for a lifetime.”

In the very broadest sense, any decision a shadowrunner makes about the use of violence comes down to weighing principle against practicality. Unfortunately, that’s where the simple statements end and the stereotypes begin. One of the most popular ones is that runners who argue against violence are always members of the various goody-two-shoes groups in the shadow community, while the runners who treat “less-lethal” ammunition with the same disdain as I treat decaf coffee (seriously, why does that exist?) are all self-centered moneygrubbers.

Anyone who’s waiting for me to say “you’re wrong,” good on you for paying attention. The truth is that there are both principled and practical arguments on both sides of the violence coin. Let’s go through a few of the most common ones.

## Yea

### Dead People Don’t Wake Up

Overwhelmingly heard in the context of someone explaining why they blew that poor corpsec guard’s head off instead of just knocking them out. Having an enemy you thought you neutralized shake off their stupor and block your planned escape route is not fun, and sometimes leads to merciful souls getting shot in the back for their trouble.

### Less-Lethal is Expensive

You’ll mostly hear this argument from runners who are already stuck scraping up every last nuyen they can to try to keep a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. I can’t really blame someone for buying cheaper ammo so they have enough money left over to eat. On the other hand, some of the people who complain about the price of less-lethal ammo only do so after they’ve spent most of their money on APDS and EX-Explosive rounds, or are just such goddamn cheapskates that they flat-out refuse to buy anything other than regular ball ammo no matter how much money they have.

THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS // WHY USE VIOLENCE?


---


# They Deserve to Suffer/Die for What They’ve Done

Most often comes from hooders and other goody-two-shoes runners, probably because the money-grubbers don’t think *anything* is immoral enough to deserve punishment, as long as it turns a profit.

> Hey! I resemble that!  
> Kane  
> We know.  
> /dev/grrl

# They’re Too Dangerous to be Left Alive/Capable

A combination of *Dead People Don’t Wake Up* and *They Deserve to Suffer/Die For What They’ve Done*, on the grounds that destroying someone’s ability to carry out certain acts (including by killing them, since death tends to severely limit one’s options) is the only way to prevent them from doing something in the future that’s morally wrong or dangerous to the person making the argument. When done for moral reasons, this is basically the “lesser evil” argument applied to a specific person and punishment. It’s also my go-to justification for violence, probably because I spend a lot of time fighting enemies where killing them to prevent them from harming others really is the lesser evil.

# Don’t You Know Who This Is?

When the prospective victim holds significant power of their own, any harm that comes to them at the runners’ hands risks retribution, which might leave the runners worse off than if they just left the prospective victim alone.

# They Don’t Deserve This

One of the most common retorts to the *Dead People Don’t Wake Up* argument, usually combined with lines like “they’re just doing their jobs” and “everyone is someone’s child.” The implication is that since it’s possible to neutralize someone as a threat without killing them (putting aside whether it’s actually feasible to do so), and nearly anything short of killing them can be treated by modern medical science, deciding to go ahead and kill them anyway is cruel and unjustifiable.

# THEY’RE WORTH MORE ALIVE

The companion and/or inverse to Don’t You Know Who This Is? The exact circumstances range from a prospective victim offering to flip and work for the runners (or at least help them access a more attractive target) to a target’s bounty being higher for a live capture than for a corpse.

# VIOLENCE IN THE REAL WORLD: FOUR PROFILES

Rather than spend this *entire* file feeding you all my own opinion, I’ve taken the liberty of interviewing non-me runners from different backgrounds so that you can all see how violence has shaped our lives from a variety of perspectives. Two of them are even fellow JackPointers, so you’ll see some familiar faces (though not necessarily welcome ones). I sent all four of them a questionnaire about how violence factors into their approach to running the shadows, including how and where they decide to draw the line, if at all. That should provide a nice cross-section of the different approaches shadowrunners take to deciding when and how much violence to use, so please, read on.

## BORDERLINE'S STORY

Well, this wasn’t what I expected when I thought that joining JackPoint might get people to start caring about Redmond, but I’m not gonna turn down someone who PMs me and offers double what I normally pull on a run just to write some drek down. In case you don’t already know, I’m a Barrens brat, born and bred. Anyone who works the Seattle shadows has probably been to Redmond before, whether you were on a run, hiding out after one, or just couldn’t afford to live anywhere nicer. Like most Barrens neighborhoods, Redmond is full of people who don’t have a problem using force to get their way. Anyone stupid enough to set foot outside Touristville without a gun they know how to use probably deserves to get rolled for everything they own.

> Let me guess: If you stay in Touristville, you can get away with just showing a gun instead of using it?  
> — Mika

> Pretty much. Me and a couple of the more socially acceptable ‘Weeners do “security” gigs sometimes, where we take normies to relatively safe parts of Redmond and make them pay through the nose for the privilege. All you gotta do is feed ‘em lines like “trust me, the people out there don’t respect any gun smaller than this” while you flash the Super Warhawk at your hip, and you can pretty much name your price.  
> — Borderline

The part a lot of people don’t get is that for all the normie news likes to talk about “gang-related shootings” and all that bulldrek, a lot of people in Redmond don’t actually *want* to fight. We will when we have to, and sometimes people get into a scrap for fun or because someone got slotted off about something, but everyone from Redmond—probably from every Barrens everywhere, really—knows that fighting means risk, and risk is something that your average person in Redmond won’t accept unless they don’t have a choice. Sure, things *might* get better, but most Barrens brats grow up in a world where “uncertain” means “we don’t know how bad it is yet.” It means that maybe the gang made up of local kids who use some of the cred they make selling drugs to buy food for their families gets replaced with a gang from a different part of the Metroplex who just wants to squeeze people for every nuyen they have. Most people only turn the corner to violence if they’re out of their heads (either on chips or drugs, or because they’re just legit nuts), or out of desperation. I’m sure someone who actually read stuff as a kid can toss out a saying about cornered animals or whatever.

The point is, a lot of people from the Barrens turn to violence because that’s just what it takes for us to take care of each other. I don’t think it’s any different than stealing food to make sure my family can eat or beating someone into a pulp so they stop harassing my friends. I guess a part of me thinks it’d be nice if I didn’t have to make my living by hurting other people, but I don’t think too much about it either way. It’s just a job that I do, and one I happen to be pretty good at. The same goes for how much violence I use on a run. I don’t go out of my way to geek people unless they give me a reason, and I don’t complain as much as some people do if Mr. Johnson insists that we do a run non-lethally. On the other hand, I don’t go out of my way to wait until the other guy shoots first or insist on changing the entire plan for a run just because we ran out of gel rounds, especially against the corps. Those guys all have armor and on-site medics and drek, it’s not like they’re going to bleed out and die in the five minutes it takes them to get help.

> Not to be That Person, but actually, people **can** bleed out that fast if the wound’s in the right place—including places that aren’t as obviously dangerous as a head or body shot, like the shoulder and thigh, if you manage to nick an artery. Just thought I’d mention it, in case people who care about that kind of thing are reading.  
> — Butch

When it comes to the kinds of jobs I take, I don’t shy away from runs just because they involve violence; I’m a razorgirl, for Ghost’s sake. I don’t mind taking wetwork contracts if the target looks like they deserve it. (I haven’t been offered any where they didn’t, so I guess we’ll see what happens when that day comes.) On the other hand, I’m not above turning a job down if it looks too bat-drek crazy, like hurting kids or something—or at least, I hope I’m not above that. As cynical as I am about life sometimes, I know some people don’t actually deserve the drek they put up with, and I hope I never have to choose between hurting an innocent person and letting my people suffer.

So, that’s my answer. This got longer than I expected, but I guess that’s what happens when you’ve got a few drinks in you and start writing about deep, thoughtful drek. Speaking of which, here’s to you, Freya. The Halloweeners appreciate your donation to the “Get More and/or Nicer (But Probably More) Booze” fund, some of which went into the writing of this post, and everyone decided we should raise a glass to say thanks.

> Aw, that’s sweet of you. May your drinks go down smoothly and your hangovers be light.  
> Freya

> Don’t encourage her.  
> Lyran

## CLOCKWORK'S STORY

First of all, don’t get the idea that I’m doing this because I feel like I have to justify myself to any of you, or because I want to try to win any of you bleeding hearts over. I think you all know by now that I don’t really give a fuck what any of you think. I’m writing this little tale because Freya paid me to do it—which, when I think about it, is actually a pretty good summary of why I run the way I do.

> Wait, someone **paid** him for his drivel? You know he normally does it for free, right?  
> Slamm-0!

> He normally says whatever crosses his mind for free, yes. I had specific questions I wanted answered, so I thought I’d try my luck treating it like any other job. Besides, this way he can’t say that people haven’t heard his side of the story.  
> Freya

Some of you know that I’m a hobgoblin—a subtype of ork—and that my metavariant’s known for our quick tempers and strong senses of honor. I’m sure you most of you chuckleheads would say that when it comes to yours truly, you agree with the first and call bulldrek on the second. I mean, a guy like me who turns techno-freaks in for bounties and won’t even meet a Johnson without having nuyen thrown at me can’t possibly have a “sense of honor,” right? Well, don’t worry, I’m not about to tell you all that I’m actually a stand-up guy who’s been horribly misunderstood. For one thing, none of you would believe me. Even if you did, Freya paid me for the truth, so that’s what you’re getting.

My family’s from Central Asia, via the Balkans—or at least, they were. I haven’t seen any of them since I was a kid, so I have no idea if they’re still alive. How I got from that part of the world to where I am now is none of your business, but I’ll tell you one thing: I have a strong sense of honor. The difference between me and the bleeding hearts is that my code is survive, no matter what it takes. I learned pretty early in my life that all metahumans are bastards. Doesn’t matter what shape your ears are, whether you’ve got tusks or not, the color of your skin; everyone you meet will gladly sell you out if it means they get ahead. The only person who *really* cares about you is you, and if you let yourself think any different, you’ll get a bullet to the head in your sleep.

Look at the way the corps run the world and tell me I’m wrong. Hell, if you don’t want to look at the corps, look at yourselves. Every single one of us on this VPN has done someone’s dirty work to make sure we can pay our bills. The only difference between me and you is that I’m not squeamish about getting a little blood on my hands. Whoever I’m gunning down would gladly do the same to me if it was their life on the line. Most of *you* would gladly geek me just because I say things you don’t like. Gripe all you want about how much of an asshole I am, but you don’t see me going around threatening people because they hurt my feelings.

> You did a lot more than hurt people’s feelings, jackass. You sold them out, put their lives in danger—but I guess you don’t really care about that, do you?  
> Pistons

> Nope.  
> Clockwork

Since Freya asked me to talk about how I “choose to employ violence” or some bulldrek, the simple answer is this: I do whatever it takes to finish the job with a minimum of risk to myself. Dead guards don’t wake up and sound an alarm, and if you’ve got a decent hacker on your team you don’t have to worry about their biomonitors doing it for them. Besides, most of those fuckers would gladly put a bullet in me just for being somewhere they don’t want me to be. Drones and weapons can be replaced—it’s not always cheap, but being a runner isn’t some childish Matrix game like some people seem to think it is. You can’t just respawn.

> Balladeer  
> Fair point.  
> Kia  

The other reason I don’t shy away from violence is because I have a rep to protect with people whose opinions I *do* care about—namely, Johnsons. I’ve got bills to pay, just like the rest of you, and a pretty big chunk of my work comes from Johnsons who want a runner that’ll get the job done no matter what it takes. If a potential employer comes to me with a run, refusing it on principle because I want to be one of the “good guys” isn’t going to save whoever and their dog from getting whacked. It just means the job’ll go to someone else, maybe someone who isn’t as careful about following a “no collateral damage” clause as I am because they don’t care about their rep like I care about mine. It also means less money in my pocket, which pretty clearly goes against the “survive” part of my code.  
So, that’s my story. I won’t bother asking what you all think of it, because Freya didn’t pay me to pretend I care. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go make a pile of nuyen off the jobs all the bleeding hearts turned down.

## Sikh Burn's Story

> Sikh Burn is an acquaintance from the Emerald Palace host; you probably saw his name in the posting that Lyran forwarded to JackPoint in the **Cutting Black** download. Since runners who can maintain a sense of restraint when they’re immersed in violence are in fairly short supply, I decided to get in touch with him to shed some light on how he balances his principles with his work.  
> Freya  

We Sikhs have a dualistic relationship with violence. Our faith requires us to be kind and humble to all people, especially those in need, which you’d expect to limit how much violence any particular Sikh is willing to employ. At the same time, the Sikhs have a long and venerated martial tradition. One of the Sikh Gurus, Guru Hargobind, encouraged all Sikhs to become *sant sipahi*—”saint-soldiers”—after his predecessor was executed by the Mughal Emperor. Another Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, founded the Khalsa so that we could protect ourselves against religious persecution. Many Sikhs served in the British Raj’s armies before India won its independence, and many still serve proudly in the militaries of their home countries today. Sikhs are also some of the best-known proponents of Indian martial arts, like *gatka*, *musti-yuddha*, *shastar vidya*, and cricket.

> Wait, cricket?  
> Glitch  
> I take it you’ve never seen what a good swing from a cricket bat can do to a person’s skull. Some of the last real-wood cricket bats in the world are made in the same part of India where the Sikhs come from.

> I would’ve never taken you for a cricket fan, Chainmaker.  
> Winterhawk  
> I dated a cricketer once. Decided I liked the sport better than I liked him.  
> Chainmaker  

Freya came to me to get (in her words) a “restrained/pacifist” perspective, but for both Sikhs in general and me personally, our restraint in using violence isn’t about pacifism so much as justice. I don’t have a problem with using violence on runs as long as it’s done for the right reasons. If I know there’s a threat coming, I’d rather strike preemptively than risk more people getting hurt or dying because I waited to act. That includes taking wetwork contracts if killing the target would prevent a greater harm, although I do have a personal rule about assassinations: I’ll only accept money to kill someone if they’re enough of a scumbag that I would’ve done it for free. I know most Johnsons only care about whether I’ll take the job or not, but I value my principles, and that’s the best way I’ve found to make sure I don’t kill someone just to satisfy my own greed.

> And that’s why people like him stay broke.  
> Rigger X  

Having said that, my feeling justified in killing in certain circumstances is a personal choice, not a religious one. Some Sikhs follow the “peace and non-violence” thing more strictly than I do, whether that means never being the one who starts the fight, only using enough force to stop an imminent threat, only using non-lethal techniques or weap-

ons, or whatever. For me, if I run into an enemy  
who isn’t a direct threat—like a corpsec guard who  
hasn’t spotted me, for example—I might knock  
them out with a Stunbolt spell or the hilt of my *khanda* instead of shooting them, but I won’t bend  
over backward to keep them alive if they take the  
first shot. I also avoid hurting captured or other-  
wise defenseless enemies, which came in handy  
when I got stuck in Toronto during the blackouts  
but got me into trouble when my team and I had to  
face down a toxic kinship spirit that took the form  
of a small child. One of my teammates nearly got  
killed because I hesitated instead of attacking the  
spirit, and having to “kill” something that looked  
like a young kid messed me up for a while after-  
ward. (I got over it eventually, but I’d be complete-  
ly fine with that never happening again.)  
As for how all this affects which jobs I take, the  
only hard limit I have is that I won’t directly help  
someone exploit or oppress others. (I try not to  
do it indirectly either, but that’d mean not taking  
work from most of the Johnsons out there, and a  
guy’s gotta eat.) I help out around the community  
when I can, and if I take a run from a corp or syn-  
dicate Johnson, it’s usually one that targets one of  
their rivals instead of a third party.  

## VIKING COWGIRL'S STORY  
Surprise! It’s Freya again. Yes, I know the title is  
“Viking Cowgirl’s Story,” and no, I’m not her. She’s  
part of a team I work with sometimes along with  
another fellow member of the Emerald Palace host  
(and actually is a viking cowgirl), and I was going  
to ask her to write a little bit about why and how  
she managed to remain a committed pacifist while  
working the shadows. Unfortunately, we had a  
not-very-cash-money incident in Baltimore during  
the blackouts that culminated in her trying to kill  
me. Since she was obviously no longer a pacifist at  
that point, I’ve decided to just share my observa-  
tions of her pre-violence life instead, with a bit of  
my own commentary included.  
To begin, yes, someone actually tried to be a  
pacifist shadowrunner. JackPoint triumvirate, I’ll  
leave it up to you to decide how many of the “wait,  
people actually *do* that?” comments to leave in,  
and we’ll continue once everyone’s gotten it out of  
their systems.

Anyway, back to the Viking Cowgirl. She’s a  
magician and a street doc, one of the few who ac-  
tually went to medical school. As far as I can tell,  
she became a shadowrunner so she could “help  
people” instead of sliding into a cushy corporate  
job that many mages would kill to have (figura-  
tively or literally), which should tell you something  
about both her ideals and the strength of the con-  
viction behind them. It’s no great leap of logic to  
figure out how someone with that outlook on life  
might decide that the best way to help people was  
to start by not hurting them—thus, the pacifism.  
When I say pacifism, I mean *pacifism*. The Vi-  
king Cowgirl didn’t quite go to the extreme of  
never harming anyone for any reason, but she got  
closer to that point than any other shadowrunner  
I’ve ever seen. There was no pre-empting anything  
with her, even when there was an obvious immi-  
nent threat. She wouldn’t even make the first move  
when she and her team were staring down the  
barrels of hostile guns; the bad guys had to make  
the first move, and the Viking Cowgirl would even  
try to keep her teammates from starting a fight on  
their terms instead of the enemy’s. (It usually didn’t  
work, but that didn’t stop her.)

When the Viking Cowgirl did get into a fight,  
she focused on illusion spells and non-lethal spells  
like Clout and Stunbolt; come to think of it, I’m  
not sure she’s learned any lethal spells even now.  
She was just as determined not to hurt anyone on  
a broader scale, too. According to other members  
of the team, there were several occasions where  
the Viking Cowgirl refused to commit to joining  
the team a run unless they assured her they would  
make every effort not to harm anyone unnecessar-  
ily. There was at least one case where she didn’t  
know the team had taken a wetwork assignment  
(she missed the meeting with the Johnson) until af-  
ter she’d showed up at the site where the run was  
to take place, and only participated out of a sense  
of loyalty to her teammates.

To her credit, the Viking Cowgirl actually kept the exercise up for a couple of years before she cracked. As I understand it, her slow and steady withdrawal from giving peace a chance began when a former acquaintance used her pacifism against her. Said former acquaintance tried to unleash a nano-plague or something on Seattle and invited the Viking Cowgirl to watch, while deliberately not taking any actions aggressive enough for her to feel justified in attacking him. After some intense moral wrangling, the Viking Cowgirl finally shot him in the back, then spent a couple of weeks moping about how she’d gone against her beliefs and refusing to accept that she shouldn’t feel bad for stopping a mass murder. Within a few months, she’d gone from being all “but that’d hurt people!” to beheading a defenseless bounty hunter (which surprised everyone) and trying to kill me (which, to my annoyance, did *not* surprise everyone). In fairness, she fell under the influence of a toxic power focus at some point, so I can’t be certain whether or how much longer she would have continued her non-aggressive streak if not for the outside interference.

> “Fell under the influence of a toxic power focus”? Should we take that to mean that she’s actually become a toxic magician?  
> Winterhawk

> No, she hasn’t. She was manipulated into taking the focus by a toxic magician, but her team intervened and got rid of it before the Viking Cowgirl went past the point of no return. Incidentally, her trying to kill me was a reaction to my killing the toxic magician who’d been manipulating her. Hopefully, her team will help her come to her senses before she tries that again, because I’m not inclined to give her a third chance if she blows the second one.

# THE HIERARCHY OF VIOLENCE

As I sincerely hope all of you know, some forms of violence are more severe than others. Even people who loudly proclaim their lack of concern with morals tend to think certain types of violence are “worse” than others (which is why child abusers and sex offenders don’t tend to last long in prison). The more severe the violence, the harder it is to justify, both on moral grounds and because acts that I consider “more severe” violence tend to require more time or more expensive ordnance to carry out.

There’s one very important caveat any time you resort to violence: For it to be effective in getting you what you want, it has to scare the target into believing that something they can’t handle will happen if they resist. They have to be convinced that what happens next is more trouble for them than giving you what you want, because if they aren’t, they’re probably going to fight back instead of caving to your demands. If that happens, you either just end up with more enemies, or you create a lot more work for yourself by having to find another option after you kill them in self-defense.

## Threats and Intimidation

For most “normal people,” such as corp drones, a convincing threat of violence can be just as effective at getting what you want as actually inflicting harm on them. Make mean faces, snarl a little, whack your free hand with a lead pipe for emphasis, and you’ll usually have them bending over backward to do whatever it is you want them to do. Against steelier souls such as crime bosses or your fellow shadowrunners, making an effective threat takes a little more work; for most of us, the possibility of injury or death is too routine to be truly scary. Being able to threaten people like that is a matter of digging around in their lives until you find out what they fear most (which is a dangerous game in itself). On the bright side, a threat that doesn’t lead to actual harm isn’t nearly as much of a moral burden as one that does, so you can throw these around pretty freely.

## Vandalism

Everyone’s seen thugs break store windows to convince the owner to sign up for a protection racket. (I’m sure a few of you have even been the thugs doing the breaking.) For our purposes, “vandalism” includes anything that involves wrecking the target’s stuff instead of wrecking the target (or their ability to harm you) directly. Usually, vandalism serves to both inflict harm by making the target pay to replace things, and stoke their fear that


---


# Physical Injury

Obviously, hurting a person is more, well, personal than just hurting their stuff. Technology has blurred the lines a little bit between this and the previous level; if you smash someone’s cyberarm with a hammer, is that an injury or vandalism? What if it’s one of those modular cyberarms that happens to be detached when you smash it? What if it’s a decker’s cyberdeck, and you smash it while they’re jacked in? Anyway, the other issue with physical injury isn’t moral so much as practical: thanks to both technology and magic, it’s getting harder and harder to hurt someone in a way that’ll actually stick. In days gone by, putting a bullet through the back of somebody’s knee meant a lifetime of pain and suffering, but nowadays it’s just another reason for them to get a cyberleg.

> Spoken like someone who doesn’t know or care that some people can’t afford cyberlegs.  
> Borderline

# Psychological Injury

In a world where nearly any wound short of death can be shrugged off with enough healing magic or ’ware, the ones that stick with people are the ones that damage the mind and soul, not the body. This usually requires a closer call than threats and intimidation, but whatever the target’s worst fear is doesn’t actually have to happen; this kind of approach can be just as effective with near-misses as hits, so long as they’re close enough to make the target think they were going to happen. If you’re the kind of person who values their moral compass, be very careful when using this tactic, or avoid it entirely. Making someone think their worst fear is coming to pass can fuck them up for the rest of their lives.

# Mind Control Is Not the "Nice" Option

Being a magician who at least attempts to care about doing the right thing, I meet a lot of magicians who claim that using spells that dig directly into their target’s heads is somehow more humane than taking physically violent options, like using Mind Probe instead of torturing someone for information or casting Control Thoughts to make an enemy drop their gun instead of shooting them. More foul-mouthed runners call these sorts of tactics “mind-rape,” and although I despise that term, I’m using it here because it’s accurate. Robbing someone of their ability to feel safe within their own head is a torture all its own. That doesn’t mean you should never use that kind of magic—there’s been at least one case where I’ve used the Mind Probe spell to dig up information that saved innocent lives—but anyone who places value on respecting others’ rights shouldn’t toss it around willy-nilly. If nothing else, you might end up being the reason some innocent magician gets lynched when paranoid mundanes accuse them of poking around in people’s heads.

* This goes for deckers, too. It’s easy for us to forget that there can be people behind the icons we frag with Black IC, and getting your brain scrambled gets you just as dead as a bullet.
* Bull

## Violence and Codes

When you’re mid-run and one of your team refuses to shoot first, it doesn’t really matter whether it’s because they think it’s dishonorable to ambush an unsuspecting target, because Cat wants them to toy with their prey, or because they’re too soft-hearted to actually *hurt* someone who isn’t a threat to them. So, I’m going to refer to all the ways that our thoughts influence our willingness to use violence—whether they’re ethical codes like the ever-popular *bushido*, the demands of a mentor spirit, psychological conditioning, laws (ha!), or just plain squeamishness—as “codes of conduct.”

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get down to business. How do codes of conduct influence our willingness to use violence? Frankly, they tend to cause more violence than they stop, at least in my experience. “But wait,” you might say, “aren’t people who follow a code always jabbering on about how disciplined and restrained they are, or how resorting to violence is beneath them?” Yes, we do tend to do that, but that doesn’t mean we commit violence less often than others. In fact, anyone who commits violence often enough to need rules for when and how to do it won’t be restrained *that* much by following a code. So, why bother with codes at all?

> Finally.  
> Clockwork

I usually divide the reasons up into two categories: pragmatism (doing something because you stand to gain from it) and principle (doing something because you think it’s a good idea even when you don’t stand to gain from it). For me, there are a few pragmatic reasons for following a code (or several intermingling codes, in my case). The first is that leaving lower body counts, and being choosy about who’s included in those body counts, makes me less of a priority for the cops. Personally, I’d rather deal with the extra hassle of having to finish a job before security wakes up than pack up my entire life and leave town because the police are knocking at my door.

* Don’t do this unless you can handle getting shot in the back. It’s all well and good to prefer harder runs over dealing with cops, but I’d rather have to leave town after shooting a bunch of corpsec guards than end up in a morgue because a bad guy didn’t stay knocked out.
* Hard Exit
* Besides, it’s not like the bad guys’ll go easy on **you** just because you’re using gel rounds. Why bother doing them a favor?
* Borderline
* Because some of us think it’s important to be better people than our enemies. If we can’t do that, the world will never change.
* Old Crow

The second pragmatic reason is that the power boost I gain from following a mentor spirit depends on following the rules my Mentor lays out for me. Considering that most of the work I take involves dealing with various kinds of magical threats, that power boost is incredibly useful to me—certainly worth the trouble of making sure I keep my promises.

That dovetails nicely with the third pragmatic reason, which is that when people know that you have a code and stick with it, they’re more likely to trust your word. They might not respect the ideals of your code, but smart Johnsons will recognize that if you have the willpower and integrity to follow a code when nobody’s forcing you to, they can probably rely on you to finish the job you’re given.

* Or they’ll think you’re too stupid to try to double-cross them, which is pretty much the same thing for their purposes.
* Rigger X
* The greater danger is that doggedly following an ethical code of any kind makes you predictable. Anyone who might try to manipulate you will know that it’s possible to push your buttons, if not exactly which buttons to push.
* Thorn

In the same vein, some Johnsons offer jobs that pay extra if you limit the collateral damage. For wetwork jobs, the definition of “collateral damage” usually includes killing anyone other than the specified target or targets. Those extra payouts can add up, and going to the trouble of following Mr. Johnson’s instructions usually makes it more likely that you’ll get more work from them in the future.

As for the principled reasons … first of all, anyone who didn’t like the hooding piece I wrote might as well check out now, because it’s going to be more of the same (which you really should’ve guessed without me telling you).

If you’re still here, you probably already have a sense of why someone might limit their use of violence on principle. To put it simply, it’s because they care about seeing themselves as a good person. You might’ve already heard pithy sayings like, “every villain is the hero of their own story.” Even the most proudly self-proclaimed amoral (as opposed to immoral) shadowrunner follows a set of personal values, where their “highest good” is personal profit, and anyone who stands between them and their own profit has committed a sin worthy of death. They just don’t like to think of it in terms of “good” and “evil” because it would undermine their belief in their superiority over the chumps who still believe in quaint concepts like morality.

Metahumanity has an incredible capacity for twisting our own logic to justify our actions as being “for the greater good,” no matter how much harm we inflict as a result. We do that because the alternative is to face the possibility that we aren’t as righteous as we think we are, and for some people, the realization that none of the horrible things they’ve done were justified is too much to bear.

# Honor Roll

Whether they’re practical or not, a good many shadowrunners (and people with whom shadowrunners interact) follow their own codes of conduct, or “codes of honor” for the more romantically inclined. I thought it might be useful to provide a small sampling of the codes of conduct I’ve run into over the years, so that you can all see the variety of beliefs that shape your fellow shadowrunners. As an aside, many of these codes I describe here don’t deal exclusively with violence. They do, however, have various restrictions on when and how violence can be used.

# “Amoral” vs. “Immoral”  
**Posted by: Thorn**

Since it seems Freya’s skipped over this distinction in her rush to tell us everything we’re doing wrong with our lives, and it’s been a fair while since I’ve taken on a philosophy-professor cover, I thought I’d drop this explanation in.

To keep things simple (since I’m sure you all know this already), moral basically means “right,” in the “right and wrong” sense. Saying someone’s acting in a moral way means they’re “doing the right thing” (whatever “the right thing” happens to be in that particular case), because it’s the right thing to do. By the same token, saying that someone’s acting in an immoral way means that they’re “doing the wrong thing” because it’s the wrong thing to do.

The reason I’ve emphasized the person’s motives is because where moral and immoral people do things because they’re right or wrong, amoral people—including most shadowrunners, and most corps, for that matter—do things for reasons that aren’t related to right and wrong, like how much a given action will profit them. I’m not going to touch Freya’s assertion that profiteering is a moral code in itself, because I’m sure that argument will explode quickly enough to make the triumvirate unhappy.

# More Codes

The codes of conduct introduced in this section are meant to supplement those listed under the Honorbound quality found on p. 76 of *Shadowrun, Sixth World*.

# Omertà, the Code of Silence

* May not kill police officers  
* May not oppose a superior in the Family  
* May not give information to legal authorities  

You’ve probably heard of this from wiseguy trids (and wiseguy flatvids before that), but although *omertà* originated with the Mafia, most other criminal syndicates have similar oaths of loyalty and so on. The main difference between *omertà* and other syndicates’ codes is the specific prohibition of violence against police.

# THE CODE OF WUXIA
* May not harm the innocent  
* May not accept bribes or misuse authority  
* May not serve the corrupt  

I have to say, I like these guys. There’s a lot of cross-pollination between followers of the Code of Wuxia and disciples of Dragonslayer. Most of them aren’t afraid to have a drink or three to celebrate a shared love of fighting the wicked and corrupt powers that rule society, and the ones who have been around for a while are world-class ass-beaters. There aren’t many of them in the shadows, mainly because they consider taking jobs from corporate or syndicate Johnsons “serving the corrupt.” On the contrary, many of the Wuxia devotees I’ve met have teamed up with anti-corp or neo-anarchist activist groups.

> Since we don’t have Sticks around to bring it up again, I’ll mention it for him: Many followers of Wuxia get funding and other material support from Wuxing, usually through Buddhist temples in the Chinese nations. That funding makes its way all over the world, including into Aztlán, where a Wuxia follower named Monkey Mocks the Donkey from the Treetops (or “Mocking Monkey”) has been leading the charge against Aztechnology.

## THE PALADIN'S CODE  
_(ELVEN CHIVALRY, MES TI'BELETRESA)_
* May not break one’s word  
* May not harm the innocent  
* May not allow art or beauty to come to harm  

Oh, I could go on about this subject for pages and pages.

> Please, someone stop her.  
> Frosty

I’m sure you’re all preemptively sick of my rambling, though, so I’ll keep it brief. The Paladins’ Code (or Mes ti’Beletresa in Sperethiel) originated in the Tírs. (Nobody’s quite sure whether it was Tír Tairngire or Tír na nÓg that first made it an institution, and I’m sure there’ll be arguments about that for as long as both countries exist.) We follow all the usual chivalric tenets, like fighting against evil and injustice and maintaining our loyalty to crown and nation, although exactly how one defines “crown” and “nation” is open to a great deal of interpretation; I’ve heard stories of the Ancients using a variant of the Paladins’ oaths in their swearing-in ceremonies, replacing the “crown” with the captain of the local chapter and the “nation” with the gang itself.

The main difference between the Mes ti’Beletresa and similar codes from other areas is that the elven nations appreciate beauty the same way we appreciate honor, justice, valor, and all the other knightly virtues. If you’ve ever wondered why so many elven paladins are so vain (myself included), it’s because we haven’t just vowed to defend our principles—we’ve literally sworn oaths to look good doing it.

> That is the elfiest thing I’ve ever heard.  
> Sunshine

In the old days, I would’ve said that the Paladin’s Code was also set apart by being an all-elven institution, but that hasn’t been the case for almost two decades. Larry Zincan, the former High Prince of Tír Tairngire, had a good number of his fellow orks as Paladins even before they took the top job, and many of the current Council of Princes have based their hiring decisions more on merit than metatype lately. Plenty of people outside the Tírs have also used the recent mainstream explosion of “elven spirituality” as an excuse to declare themselves “paladins” of somethingorother, which frankly irritates the hell out of me—but that’s not critical to my central point, so I’ll save that discussion for later.

## THE SOLDIER'S CODE
* Must obey orders from superiors  
* May not loot the dead or allow them to be looted  
* May not lie to superiors  
* Must maintain honorable conduct and obey the rules of war  
* May not harm or torture prisoners  

I’ve had the pleasure of serving with a number of fine soldiers in my career—and many others, at least one of whom lurks here on JackPoint. (Nah, I’m kidding. Rifleman’s good people, he just never takes me anywhere nice.)

> You didn’t have to come to Detroit, you know.  
> Rifleman  
> You flat-out admitted that you asked me because you knew Dragonslayer wouldn’t let me say no.  
> Freya  
> Pfft, details.  
> Rifleman

In some ways, modern soldiers are the most like runner-like of non-shadowrunners, which probably explains why so many ex-soldiers end up becoming runners. Both professions live by the principle that the mission comes first, and both accept that getting the job done might involve jumping through some morally-questionable hoops.

**THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS // HONOR ROLL**


---


On the other hand, soldiers are usually subject to many more rules than shadowrunners are—or at least, they care more about following the rules that apply to them. A runner might show a casual disregard for the laws of the land with few or no consequences, but any soldier who wants to earn a legitimate living quickly learns that regulations—whether they’re the military law of a nation’s armed forces, or the policies set out by the various bodies that regulate mercenary units—are non-negotiable, and that breaking them could lead to a long stay in the stockades, if not being stripped of your uniform (sometimes literally).

> To be fair, literal uniform-stripping is more often done as a prank than an actual punishment. Dishonorable discharges usually involve less clothing removal and more boot-to-ass.  
> Picador

Of course, everyone who’s worked with soldiers knows that some of them are… let’s say flexible in how they interpret their orders. It’s not uncommon for less-principled mercenaries to torture prisoners of war for intel or loot the dead for valuables if they think they can get away with it, and in a lot of places in the world, they can. When the worst punishment they face is a promising future as a shadowrunner or corporate operative, what do they have to lose?

# THE AKICHITA CODE
* May not show fear  
* Must challenge your strength against worthy foes  
* May not allow yourselves or loved ones to fall into weak or decadent behavior  
* May not harm the weak or innocent  

Two things I need to say up front: first, followers of the Akichita Code are very good at what they do, and I respect their skill. Second, I’m biased as fuck against them, so feel free to take anything bad I say about them with a grain of salt.

> Considering that many Akichita followers are current or former Sioux Wildcats and Freya was supposedly a Tír Ghost, the bias isn’t surprising. Her willingness to admit it is a little more so.  
> Mika

When I said before that some codes tend to lead to people committing more violence instead of less, the Akichita Code was the one I had in mind, especially the part about “challenge your strength against worthy foes.” I guess picking fights against people who you think can take it is better than picking fights against people who you know can’t defend themselves, but it’s still a giant fucking hassle to deal with. The part about not allowing others to fall into “weak or decadent behavior” (whatever that means) tends to make Akichita followers come across as fun-hating jackasses.

> Have you ever considered that they might’ve challenged you because they thought you’d be a worthy adversary, and that they were trying to stop you from having fun because they were concerned that you were going overboard?  
> Mika

> Of course. That doesn’t make it any less of a pain in the ass when I just want to have a few drinks, though.  
> Freya

# BUSHIDO 2.0
* Must always follow the commands of superiors, regardless of personal cost

I’ve heard from people who follow old-school bushido that this new version doesn’t deserve the name, that it’s basically just mindless obedience to corporate masters, and so on. I don’t know enough about the finer details of bushido to be able to confirm or deny that (I’m sure someone else on JackPoint can fill in the details), but I can tell you that I’ve met some Red Samurai types who claim to follow bushido but seem more than happy to do dishonorable things like lie, break promises, and make sneak attacks. For them, it seems like the “loyalty” aspect of bushido gets placed above all else.

> That’s an accurate description. Old-school bushido is built around eight different virtues that are all mostly equal in importance, although meiyo (honor) probably gets talked about more than the others. The “Bushido 2.0” fanatics take chugi (duty/loyalty) and blow it out of proportion, to the point that they can do no wrong as long as they’re following their bosses’ orders, then warp the other seven virtues so that “the right thing” and “what you were told to do” are basically the same thing.  
> Mihoshi Oni

# RULES AND CONSEQUENCES
Shadowrunners’ livelihoods revolve around being able to dodge the consequences of their actions. There’s perhaps no better example of this than one of JackPoint’s own: Kane. The man’s made an art and a science of pulling off the most daring capers he can, without becoming a problem that The Powers That Be can’t ignore.

Having an entire community band together against you is bad. Individual members of the community might not pose any serious threat, but the more of them that are willing to band together in protest, the more likely they are to disavow you (if you started off on good terms) or pool their resources towards a way of getting rid of you (if you didn’t).

# New Quality: Pacifist (1-4)

You are one of the few people remaining in the Sixth World who not only believes that violence isn’t the answer, but who actively tries to avoid violence whenever possible—even against people who get so fed up with your peaceful ways that they want to smack you.

This quality may not be taken together with the White Hat version of the Honorbound quality, but may be taken with other versions of the Honorbound Quality at the gamemaster’s discretion. (We recommend that this quality and the Honorbound quality be taken together when this quality would impose a more severe limitation than the Honorbound quality alone would.)

**Bonus**  
5 Karma per level

**Game Effect**  
As the name implies, this quality limits the ways in which a character may use violence against other characters. If the character knowingly acts against their pacifist beliefs, they may not spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after committing the violent act. Any violent act committed during that twenty-four hours extends the duration of not being able to spend or regain Edge by another 24 hours.

## Level 1  
You may only initiate violence (i.e., act in a way that results in damage being inflicted on a target) to stop a clear, imminent threat to another character, such as a hostile NPC aiming a weapon at them. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage on a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted.

## Level 2  
You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted.

## Level 3  
You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may not knowingly take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but you may still take actions that would result in inflicting Stun damage to a target.

## Level 4  
You may not knowingly commit a violent act for any reason, even in defense of yourself or others.

# Communities as Targets

Considering how shadowrunners normally operate outside “polite society,” your professional interactions with communities will usually involve them being the target of a run. The prime example of this is taking runs against megacorporations. Yes, the corps are communities, in the sense that they’re a group of people functioning as a single unit. If you don’t believe me, ask your decker to dig up some of the bulletins that corpsec offices post to warn wageslaves about the danger of shadowrunners, then compare them to any piece of war propaganda published in the history of wars, propaganda, or publishing. The “us against them” trope is unmistakable.

> *Uh, do you expect that to surprise us?*  
> *Rigger X*

> *In hindsight, no. I just keep forgetting that having spent most of my life in a country where corps aren’t treated as powers unto themselves makes **me** the weird one.*  
> *Freya*

> *The way the Telestrian family controls the government nowadays is hardly different than anywhere else. They just don’t bother to hide it.*  
> *Thorn*

In the early days, the elven nations were like that, especially after the Night of Rage proved that humans were still more than willing to persecute us over the shape of our ears. I’ll be the first to admit that we have our share of problems, ironically including how badly non-elven minorities are treated in many elven-majority communities. If Tír Tairngire and the rest have one redeeming quality, though, it’s that they offered safe haven for elves who would otherwise have been victims of hate and violence. Nowadays, orks and trolls are doing a better job of creating communities that look out for each other without all the hangups around politics. When I was in Baltimore during the blackouts, I worked with a unit from the Southern Guard, the ork-and-troll security company from Georgia. When a few of them got homesick and waxed nostalgic about how much better life was in Sweetwater Creek compared to “human cities,” it reminded me of how I used to talk about Cara’Sir.

# Violence and Heat

Everyone knows that shadowrunners have a (usually well-deserved) reputation for violence. Luckily for most runners, the amount of firepower it takes to deal with the most hyper-violent among them is too expensive to dispatch on every emergency call, making them more likely to face under-equipped beat cops than elite commandos—


---


but smart runner teams are careful to remember that beat cops and commandos share intel with each other.

Characters who have trouble hiding their identities and restraining their trigger fingers risk being marked as a high-value target (HVT) by local security. Exactly what it takes to be flagged in this way is up to the gamemaster, but as a general rule, runners are more likely to be flagged as HVTs if they’re both easily recognized and commit obvious violence in plain view. In game terms, “easily recognizable” can include any quality that grants a bonus to identifying or locating the character (such as Distinctive Style or SINner), and any feed broadcast widely enough to incur a Heat roll modifier for “media coverage (including Matrix stream)” (see the **Heat Modifiers Table**, p. 236, *SR6*), especially if the run takes place in a high-security location. “Obvious violence” can include any action with a negative value on the core rulebook’s **Reputation Changes Table** (p. 235, *SR6*) except reneging on a deal with a Johnson, and any action that qualifies as “intense violence” or murder on the core rulebook’s Heat Modifiers Table.

Once a character is flagged as a high-value target, they’ve graduated from being an “average shadowrunner” to one of the extra-special threats mentioned above. Law enforcement response times are cut by an additional 25 percent, for a total 50 percent reduction at Heat 4 and a 75 percent reduction at Heat 7 or above. Treat the local Security Zone Rating (p. 238, *SR6*) as being one level higher when determining what type of response force answers the call. (If runners flagged as HVTs are triggering security calls in Rating AAA zones, the gamemaster will have to get creative.)

Runners who make a point of concealing their identities will have an easier time dodging scrutiny from security forces, both before being flagged as a high-value target and when they’re trying to avoid being recognized as such. The details of how much a runner’s disguise will help them dodge trouble are (once again) at the gamemaster’s discretion, but common sense should prevail; a runner known for using a particular weapon wouldn’t count as “disguised” if the weapon is in plain sight during a run, even if the runner has completely hidden their own features.

The flip side is that it’s harder for runners to ditch their HVT tag than to smooth over their more run-of-the-mill crimes. Bribery and lying low (p. 237, *SR6*) won’t get a runner taken off the high-value target list; they’ve proven themselves dangerous enough that the reward for stopping their reign of terror (and the penalty for being seen as abetting it) outweighs an extra few thousand nuyen in some security guard’s cred account, and nobody who knows the character’s rep will believe that such a cold-blooded killer went soft just because they were off the grid for a while.

Finding a fall guy (p. 237, *SR6*) is possible, but will be much more difficult than normal, as the runner will have to both make the fall guy in question look as dangerous as they are and ensure that the ruse will stand up to more intense scrutiny from the authorities. Likewise, making a high-value target

Situations where the character tried and failed to prevent the breach, or just didn’t know it was going to happen (such as by not discovering information that would’ve clued them in during a run), shouldn’t be considered breaches. With that in mind, let’s look at each item in more detail.

**Breaking your own code of conduct:** This should be self-explanatory. Claiming to follow a code while acting in ways that would violate said code makes characters come across as lacking self-control at best and hypocritical at worst. Obviously, which actions are considered violations of a character’s code will differ from character to character.

**Flagrantly breaking your own code of conduct:** Players and gamemasters should work together to decide what counts as a “flagrant” breach. At a minimum, a flagrant breach should have a notably large result compared to other breaches. The degree to which the act conflicts with the character’s principles and how publicly the breach was might also affect whether a breach is considered “flagrant” or not.

**Persuading others to act in ways consistent with your own code:** If routinely ignoring a code you claim to follow is worthy of disdain, championing your code so fervently that other people are convinced of its rightness is worthy of respect. Whether or not coercing someone into acting according to your code (e.g., by putting a gun to their head instead of convincing them that your code is “right”) counts as “persuading” is up to the gamemaster.

Following a code at your own expense doesn’t earn bonus Reputation on its own. The reason for this is that many codes require self-sacrifice from their followers, and known followers of those codes tend to be judged by the standards of their code rather than those of “normal people.” A street samurai who strictly follows bushido is expected to do things like walk into a gang hideout and demand an “honorable” duel even when they know full well that they’re likely to get ambushed or swarmed for their trouble, so the request alone isn’t notable enough to earn a bonus point of Reputation. Actually convincing the gangbangers to appoint a champion for a duel might qualify for a Reputation bonus, though, since the street samurai is “persuading others to act in ways consistent to your own code.”

Additionally, some codes (like the Code of the Black Hat) expressly forbid self-sacrifice from their followers, so any Reputation gained from an uncharacteristic case of altruism would be canceled out by the Reputation losses for violating their own code.

Designation disappear by working a contact (p. 236, *SR6*) requires a higher level of clearance than your average law enforcement or corpsec contact possesses. The contact must have a minimum Connection of 6 and Loyalty of 3, will have to be persuaded to help (using whatever means the player and gamemaster deem appropriate), and their Loyalty will be reduced by 2 once the favor is done. As with working a contact to lower Heat, the runner may extend the favor of removing an HVT tag to other characters.

## Violence and Reputation

The core rulebook section on Reputation (p. 235, *SR6*) already includes examples of how the level of violence a character employs during a run might affect their interactions with others. In addition to the bonuses granted by having a Reputation of +10 or –10, characters may also benefit from being known for their willingness or unwillingness to use violence in a given situation.

Runners with a Reputation of +5 or above will receive a bonus point of Edge when attempting Social tests to avoid violence, such as convincing an NPC to surrender or cooperate without a fight. However, if they try to use the threat of violence to intimidate someone, the target will receive a bonus point of Edge to resist the attempt; nobody takes threats from a bleeding heart seriously.

Conversely, runners with a Reputation of –5 or below receive a bonus Edge when intimidating a target with the threat of violence, but grant the target a point of Edge during any attempt at a peaceful resolution; everyone knows you’re only asking for a ceasefire, so your target can’t fight back.

## Violence and Codes of Conduct

Since there are multiple ways a character’s actions might be limited by their own choice, we’ll use the term “code of conduct” (or just “code”) to include the Honorbound negative quality (p. 77, *SR6*), the Mentor Spirit positive quality (p. 73, *SR6*), and any similar qualities released in future supplements. The core rulebook section on Reputation (p. 235, *SR6*) already includes mechanics for how the degree of violence a runner team applies during their runs might affect their relations with other Sixth World entities. Characters with a code of conduct will obviously also have to consider how others view their adherence (or lack thereof) to their own code. To reflect that, we’ve included some new options for gamemasters to use when calculating Reputation changes (see box above).

# VIOLENT ENDS

**POSTED BY: BUTCH**

Dealing with violence is a very personal thing, and some of us are better at it than others. Some of you might remember when Hard Exit talked about this in an upload a few years ago, but since we’ve added new faces to JackPoint since then, I figured it was best to go over the topic again while adding some new understanding.

If you’ve gotten deep enough into the shadows to be on this host, you know that violence is a way of life for shadowrunners. Our job almost always involves hurting people, and in many cases it’s the primary objective. Violence comes at us when we’re not working, too; many runners live in dangerous parts of the sprawl to avoid cops and their constant ID checks, but that comes at the cost of having to arrange your own protection. Other times, being in shitty, violent circumstances in our pre-shadow lives made us become runners in the first place. Whatever the reason, it’s a rare shadowrunner who hasn’t encountered some kind of violence, whether they were dishing it out or taking it. Nobody spends much time in that environment without being affected by it somehow. For us runners, that means either learning to deal with it or letting ourselves get progressively more fucked up the longer we stay on the job.

## THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON VIOLENCE

People have written many, many books on this topic, but I’m going to keep the breakdown as simple as possible. Violence can affect you in one of three ways: by being the perpetrator, being the victim (or “survivor,” for those of you who prefer a more empowering word), or being a bystander (which is somewhere in between). The negative psychological effects that result from violence are known as “trauma.” I say that because this file is


---


going to talk a lot more about trauma than about violence, for reasons I’ll go into later.

The “survivor” part is pretty easy to understand: something bad happens to you, you become scared that it’ll happen again. “Once burned, twice shy” and all that. The “perpetrator” part has probably raised eyebrows among a few of you. After all, if you’re willing to hurt someone in the first place (we’re assuming you did it on purpose), you either felt justified in doing it, or you didn’t care whether it was justified or not. Why would doing something that you had a good reason for fuck with your head?

The thing is, logic doesn’t really enter into it. Dealing with the effects of violence is an almost completely emotional process, and unless you go out of your way to be aware of that when you’re working through it, a lot of it happens unconsciously. That’s why you see so many grizzled old cops insisting they did the right thing while they drink themselves to death out of guilt—it’s a stereotype for a reason, folks. The other reason that strategy doesn’t work is that a lot of the time, they’re fighting the wrong battle. The easiest way to understand this is to think of your mind as being an “emotional body” the same way you have a physical body. Different circumstances in your life can cause emotional “injuries” the way that they cause physical injuries. Minor disappointments are the equivalent of a bruise, major ones are more like a broken bone, and truly traumatic incidents are the emotional version of life-threatening wounds (which is why people get so shaken up by near-death experiences). The point is, telling yourself that your injury was for a good reason doesn’t make it heal faster.

To stick with the analogy, as we go through life, we build up scars and old injuries on our emotional body the same way we do on our physical body. The difference is that our minds aren’t as good at repairing themselves as our bodies are—and unlike our bodies, we can’t just replace pieces of our mind that get worn out or heal them with magic—so that damage is more likely to build up as time goes on. When the damage hits a point that our minds aren’t capable of compensating for on their own, they stop working properly, and that’s when you start going crazy.

> So … she’s saying that the way we cope with trauma is like an emotional immune system? Over-stress it too much and you start getting sick?  
> Riot

> Exactly. I see you’ve been paying attention to Butch’s lectures.  
> The Smiling Bandit

# WHAT CAUSES (AND DOESN’T CAUSE) TRAUMA

Some younger runners I’ve talked to have the impression that it’s the constant danger of life in the shadows that makes shadowrunners crack. That can contribute to the problem, but it usually isn’t the sole factor. Remember, there are plenty of dangerous jobs out there—not just the ones we always think of, like being a runner, cop, soldier, or whatever, but mundane ones like being a cook (sharp knives, open flames, and boiling oil, which was used in medieval times the same way napalm is today), construction workers (sharp, rapidly moving machines), or window washers (falling from great heights). Even crossing the street is pretty dangerous, when you think about what a moving vehicle can do to a metahuman body.

The reason we don’t have people constantly freaking out about everyday dangers is because they’re just that—everyday. Familiar. *Normal.* Everyone knows that these things are dangerous when they stop to think about it, but we’ve gotten so used to being around them that we usually *don’t* stop to think about it. For seasoned runners, the danger of getting shot during a run is no more worthy of a freak-out than the danger of being hit by a car every time they cross the street. We’ve gotten accustomed to the danger, either by going on enough runs and *not* getting shot that we believe the chances of it happening are small or by *getting* shot and surviving it so that the fear isn’t crippling anymore. To go back to the emotional body analogy, getting accustomed to danger is the equivalent of putting on an armor jacket.

> And then someone shoots you in the head.  
> Balladeer

> I’m getting to that.  
> Hard Exit

Okay, so if those are all the ways violence *doesn’t* cause emotional trauma, how *does* it? The reasons are a little different for survivors and perpetrators, but the factor they have in common is that the emotional injury that causes the trauma is the result of a betrayal, in the broader sense of “not anticipating the danger because you believed you were safe.”

> Maybe the reason this doesn’t happen to runners so much is that the ones that are dumb enough to ever believe they’re safe don’t live long enough to regret it.  
> Kane


---


When you’re the perpetrator, the betrayal comes from inside yourself instead of an outside source, and it happens because your actions go against your beliefs about who you are as a person. You usually see it when people who think of themselves as “good guys” have to do something that “bad guys” do, like when one of the few good cops left in the world shoots and kills a suspect, then has to try to reconcile “I’m a killer” with “I’m a good guy.” That moral dimension isn’t always there, though; a hardened mercenary might be able to walk through a killing field without feeling a thing but later wake up in cold sweats because they can’t square believing they’re a good soldier with having made a bad decision that got one of their subordinates killed.

> One aspect Butch doesn’t touch on directly is that feeling guilt over causing harm is a result of having empathy. The way our brains function, seeing someone express emotion causes the same centers in your brain to activate, which is why most of us wince involuntarily if we see someone else in pain.  
> — The Smiling Bandit

> On a darker note, empathy functions most strongly around people you recognize as being “the same” as you on a fundamental metahuman level. That’s why hate groups of all stripes find it so easy to inflict harm on their victims: since they’ve been primed to view their targets as “others” (and more to the point, inferior), they’re less likely to have enough empathy for their victims to restrain themselves, in the same way most people aren’t concerned about the welfare of a fly they swat.  
> — Fianchetto

On the survivor side, that feeling of betrayal is usually caused by an unexpected threat. Maybe an individual was mugged by someone hiding in an alley, or abused by someone they trusted, or even just happened to be in the path of a natural disaster. Whatever the situation, the common thread is that they thought the terrible thing they experienced couldn’t happen to them. Sometimes the possibility doesn’t even cross their mind until it actually happens, like if a neighborhood dog that’s usually friendly suddenly bites you when you pet it. Chances are, you’re not going to pet that dog again—or if you do, you’ll always be wary, because you never know when it’ll bite you again.

I think of bystanders as being between perpetrators and survivors because the violence happening to someone else gives them an emotional buffer (which adds to their mental preparedness), but the traumas they suffer are still caused by an outside source rather than their own actions. The

emotional wear and tear itself is different, too; it’s more like exhaustion from over-exertion after being around so many others who are suffering, the same way that being around a depressed person can lead to you getting depressed yourself.

> Among first responders and medical professionals, this is called “secondary traumatic stress” or “compassion fatigue.”
> Cayman

# WHAT TRAUMA LOOKS LIKE

A lot of people are familiar with the term “post-traumatic stress disorder,” or PTSD for short. I’m not going to get into all the different medical terminology bulldrek, because most of you won’t remember it in a week anyway, and it doesn’t make much of a difference in your everyday lives. To keep things simple, I’m just going to say that the root of all these different behaviors is basically fear. The behaviors themselves are the mind’s way of trying to either dampen or process that fear.

> One of the predominant theories behind PTSD is that the trauma gets “stuck” and the person re-experiences it because their brain isn’t able to process it fully. The reason it’s often so hard to treat is that because of neural plasticity (the brain changing over time), the symptoms can become more ingrained over time, as the brain starts treating that dysfunction as the new normal. Treatment usually includes a combination of psychotherapy that helps the person process the trauma out of their system, and medication that mitigates the symptoms by affecting their neurochemistry.
> Nephrine

Anxiety is common among people who suffer psychological trauma, probably because it’s so intrinsically tied to fear. This can manifest as having trouble concentrating, restlessness, and obsessive behavior that (thanks to their own peculiar brain function) suppresses the uncomfortable feelings for a while. Another common result of psychological trauma is depression, which besides the stereotypical low mood, can make it extremely difficult for a person to motivate themselves into acting (and in the most extreme cases leads to self-harm or even suicide). Insomnia is yet another common side effect of trauma, when memories of whatever caused it become too intrusive for the person to be able to sleep.

Anyone who’s seen a dark, gritty war trid knows that soldiers (and other people who have suffered trauma) often experience flashbacks. They’re a kind of delusion, in that when someone’s in the middle of a flashback, they perceive the world around them through a different filter than normal reality (which sounds kind of woo-woo, but that’s the only way I can think to describe it). One of the most important things to remember about flashbacks is that they’re very immersive—you’re not just remembering the events, you’re effectively re-experiencing them, as though you’ve traveled back in time and have to live through it all again. Another problem with flashbacks is that, like other delusions, people sometimes don’t realize that what they’re experiencing is a delusion. Their level of awareness can range from “I know that what I’m experiencing isn’t real and I can actively fight against it,” to “I know that something is wrong but I don’t know exactly what,” to thinking that others around them are the crazy ones for refusing to believe in something that’s clearly happening in front of them.

Since we’re already talking about delusions, those can be another side effect of psychological trauma. The difference between delusions and stubbornness is that a delusional person is incapable of letting go of their belief in something—not just unwilling, like they’re holding on to it for the sake of their pride or something, but actually *incapable*—even when it’s completely irrational to continue holding that belief. Paranoid delusions are relatively common among trauma survivors, probably because those delusions so often involve unexpected dangers that it just makes sense to see threats around every corner.

> Paranoia isn’t a delusion, it’s common sense.  
> Clockwork

> No, you’re missing the point. A runner who’s extremely paranoid but not delusional can at least accept the possibility of there not being a threat, like if they were in a hypothetical environment where they had complete control over every aspect of it. A delusional person would insist that there was still a threat even after they’d literally eliminated the chances of an actual threat being present.  
> Butch

## MENTAL ILLNESS OR BAD DAY?

Not everyone who feels anxious or depressed has “an anxiety disorder” or “clinical depression.” If you’ve got a big run coming up tomorrow, you’re probably going to feel stressed and frazzled about it, and maybe even have trouble sleeping the night before. If you just broke up with a significant other, you’re probably going to be bummed out (unless they were driving you up a wall, making you feel relieved when they’re gone, but you get the point). It’s only when the bad day/week/month/whatever continues on for no apparent reason that it might be a legitimate mental illness.

That said, mental illness is a genuine issue, even in our shitty world where stress and exhaustion seem to be the norm. Sometimes people can’t just “get over it,” and telling them they’re not trying hard enough isn’t going to help that (but it will make you look like an asshole).

# HOW TO DEAL

If you’ve got trauma to deal with, you’d better figure out how, because that thing will eat you alive. Anger management issues, broken relationships, trouble with steady employment—all those are common to people with untreated PTSD.

* “Anger management issues, broken relationships, trouble with steady employment” also sound like pretty much every shadowrunner.
* Stone
* Yeah, that’s not a coincidence.
* Hard Exit

It’s a cliché, but it’s true—the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting that there’s a problem. People who are not willing to admit there’s a problem deal with it in ways that cause more problems. Perhaps the most common way of denying there’s a problem, or at least dealing with it without seeking professional help, is self-medicating. People with PTSD are two to three times more likely to develop substance abuse problems than the general population. Which doesn’t necessarily help with the anger management and steady employment angles.

On top of that, the symptoms can worsen as they are untreated and can be magnified by things like substance abuse. People clearly should get help, but they don’t. Why? Because DocWagon Basic doesn’t pay for mental health. Because providers are in short supply and always booked. Because getting help is seen as weakness, and people think they should just tough it out. Because people don’t want any part of the stigma associated with mental illness.

Those are just a few reasons. If you’ve been in the shadows for a while, you probably know someone with untreated PTSD, and if you know them decently well, you know their reasons for not getting help. There are a lot of them out there, and most of them are bad. But that doesn’t stop people from using them.

There are also really unfortunate cases where people *do* reach out for help only to contact a doctor who doesn’t really pay attention to them or dismisses their complaints. This sort of thing can set people back for *years*. If you have a chance to see a doctor, take the time to ask around and find a good one. The relationship between a doctor and patient can be one of the best predictors of success when it comes to mental health, so do some legwork to give yourself better odds.

The good news is that if you go get professional help, outcomes can be positive. Even just getting a diagnosis can be helpful, as people can feel relieved to understand what’s going on in their head and learn there may be something they can do about it. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown pretty good results, basically because it does what PTSD did in the first place—it rewires your brain, except this time, it does it positively. CBT is not just one thing—there are a bunch of different approaches to treating PTSD, but the basic idea is to recognize when an episode is happening and find a way to deal with it that doesn’t include violent shaking and full-on flashbacks. Relaxation techniques and self-actualizing thoughts can also be part of the regimen, as can medications including anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs.

While treatment can be tremendously useful, it’s important to remember that it’s not a cure. You don’t make a handful of visits to the doctor and come out all better. Instead, you learn to understand your emotions better, recognize things that trigger you, and find more productive ways of dealing with negative emotions. That doesn’t make those emotions or effects go away, but it helps you find a way to live with them.

> A few years ago, I kept getting jumpy at the weirdest times, and it got bad enough that I stalled in certain situations, which is not what you want to do on a run. I’ve got the full tough-it-out mindset Butch talked about, so I tried to just keep moving ahead, but finally a friend of mine encouraged me to speak to a friend of hers, and that person got me to work on some processes. They helped me identify the trigger—I’d had a bad experience on a Lagos bridge, and it turned out even the sight of a small bridge might make me twitchy—and work on dealing with it, while also making concrete ways to counter rising anxiety. I found some other runners dealing with similar stuff, and we got together every so often just to hash things out. All that has helped—I still feel the anxiety build up sometimes, but I can push past it.

# Game Information

## The Makings of Trauma

The Sixth World is a dystopia. Bad things happen every minute. Shadowrunners often find themselves at the forefront of those bad things, whether they’re dishing them out or taking them. A character who deals with violence every day of their lives has one of two options: grow a thick skin or lose your head and probably get yourself killed. *Shadowrun, Sixth World* assumes that your group is among the ones who learned to tough it out, because if they hadn’t, their running careers would be over pretty quick.

Violence that leaves emotional as well as physical scars usually involves changing a person’s beliefs about the way the world works. Most people are so invested in their belief that “it couldn’t happen to me” or “I’m not that kind of person” that the added shock of realizing that *“it”* **can** happen or that they *are* “that kind of person” eats away at their psyche, leading to a feeling of betrayal and all the emotional wounds that come with it.

Even hardened shadowrunners usually have some form of moral principles beyond pure self-interest, and those principles are regularly tested by what they are asked to do. There is a regular series of adjustments and re-adjustments that people make in response to what they encounter and what they do, and this shapes the path they travel, along with their responses to what they see.

## Journeying Along Paths

To reflect this journey, this book introduces a concept called quality paths to represent how characters react to certain experiences and travel through a series of reactions to them. The rules for quality paths are on p. 130.

## The Resilience Test

A character’s journey down a quality path usually begins with experiencing some form of violent trauma. However, like others who are regularly exposed to violence in their everyday lives, shadowrunners have some innate resistance to those effects. To determine whether a particular violent event is enough to break through the runner’s resolve and affect them on a deeper level, gamemasters and players can use a mechanic called the **Resilience test**.

The basics of the Resilience test are simple: the player rolls 2D6, with the result modified according to the table below, and compares the result to

$$
(8 - \text{the character’s Willpower})
$$

If the player rolls higher than the target number, the character suffers no ill effects—it’s just another day in the shadows for them. If the player rolls lower than the target number, the stress has gotten to them, and they can start on a relevant quality path. If a player fails their Resilience test, they may spend 2 Edge to re-roll, as though they were re-rolling misses on any other test.

The tables below include modifiers for characters who have committed, been targeted by, or witnessed violent acts as part of life in the shadows. Unless otherwise noted, these modifiers stack with

Each other, so even one or two modifiers can make a dramatic difference on the Resilience test. Also note that these tables are only examples of modifiers that might be applied to a Resilience test. If your group runs into a situation that you feel really *should* affect the Resilience test but isn’t listed here, feel free to create your own modifier for it.

## The Ugly Consequences  
*(New and Modified Qualities)*

The heart of the quality path mechanic is, of course, qualities. Quality paths use both certain qualities found in *Shadowrun, Sixth World* and a number of new qualities introduced in this book. Groups may also use qualities released in future products if they feel it would be appropriate to include them in a quality path, including quality paths they develop.

Whenever a character fails a Resilience test against a specific type of traumatic event, the player and gamemaster may choose whether the character receives a new negative quality, or they can “upgrade” an existing negative quality to a higher level of severity. The gamemaster should approve the quality they choose to be affected. If this is the first time the character has failed their Resilience test against that type of event, they also gain the Bad Memories quality. If a character experiences a number of different types of violent events, they may receive the Bad Memories quality multiple times, with each instance of the quality applying to a different type of event.

While many paths associated with quality paths are not available to be received in any other way, the qualities listed below may be taken at character creation, with all the normal rules applying.

### Always Late

It doesn’t matter how many alarms you set or how many times your teammates call you to remind you; whether you’re constantly distracted or can’t drag yourself out of bed, you cannot show up anywhere on time to save your life. Most of the time you shrug it off, but sometimes—like when you’re supposed to meet with Mr. Johnson—it makes your team look sloppy.

**Bonus:** 2 Karma  
**Game Effects:** You always arrive at least fifteen minutes late for any scheduled event. When the event in question includes a meeting with a prospective employer, your entire team suffers a –1 penalty to social tests against Mr. Johnson due to your unprofessional behavior.

### Bad Memories

You can’t enjoy all those trids where the main character “faces their inner demons,” because they hit a little too close to home. Some nasty drek happened in the past, and it’s lurking around even today, popping up when you least expect it—and at the least convenient times.

**Bonus:** 3 Karma  
**Game Effect:** When you take (or are assigned) this quality, choose a subject of your Bad Memories. Whenever you’re required to be in the presence of that subject, you may only gain a maximum of one point of Edge per combat round, instead of the usual two.

### Compulsion  
*(Behavior, 1 to 6)*

Some people alleviate their suffering by stuffing themselves to the gills with illicit substances. You’ve chosen another way: a behavior you can’t help but indulge in, that’s less poisonous but equally toxic. This can represent anything from psychological addictions like gambling or Matrix gaming to “obsessive-compulsive” behaviors like arranging items in a certain order or repetitive handwashing.

**Bonus:** 2 Karma per level  
**Game Effect:** You must indulge in your chosen activity for a specified amount of time per day, depending on the level of the quality. Failing to do so results in you suffering withdrawal, inflicting a –2 dice pool penalty on all tests, increasing by 1 with each withdrawal period that elapses. As with the Addiction quality, you cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdrawal. However, like the modified Addiction quality

## FLASHBACKS

You haven’t been able to leave behind the effects of a trauma you experienced, to the point where certain triggers make you relive the whole experience. This goes beyond just having a recollection of the occurrence—you really feel you are there, and any other reality drops away.

**Bonus:** 6 Karma  
**Game Effect:** When selecting this quality, choose a specific event that is the subject of the flashbacks (this could be a specific in-game event that leads to the character gaining this quality). At least one, and possibly more, specific triggers should be identified. This should be multi-sensory and specific, so that it is not invoked regularly. When the character is subjected to the trigger, they must make a Composure (4) test or enter into a flashback. The flashback lasts three minutes. When the flashback starts, the character rolls a Composure (3) test; if they succeed, they recognize that they are in a flashback, and they are able to endure it. They receive a –4 dice pool penalty to any test involving Physical attributes for the duration. If they fail the second test, they cannot do anything but react to the flashback.

## MAYBE YOU MISSED SOMETHING

You can never take anyone’s word for granted—after all, people make mistakes, or even intentionally “miss” things if they’re trying to set you up for failure. With threats lurking everywhere, the only person you trust to spot danger is yourself, even if you’re not always the best person for the job.

**Bonus:** 2 Karma  
**Game Effect:** Whenever you’re in a potentially dangerous situation, you must take any feasible steps to search out potential threats. If another member of the team has already done so, you must spend at least as much time as they did completing the same task, with all the exasperation that entails (like the decker chewing out the street samurai for “checking their work”).

## PHOBIA (OBJECT)

You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question.

**Bonus:**  
* Common: 12 Karma  
* Uncommon: 9 Karma  
* Rare: 6 Karma  
* Very Rare: 3 Karma  

**Game Effect:** You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it (meaning the subject is close enough for you to believe it can affect you immediately), you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure (3) test every five minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball and hope the subject of your Phobia somehow goes away.

### SAMPLE PHOBIAS

| Common          | Ants, cats, dogs, heights, metatypes, the number 13 |

## QUALITY PATHS

The violent life of a shadowrunner can have long-term effects on the people who live it, and the choices and compromises they make can affect how they operate going forward.

Unlike other qualities, the first step on a quality path does not involve the shadowrunner either spending or gaining Karma to take the first step on the path. Instead, starting on a path is the result of a character’s decisions and the situations in which they find themselves, and their roll on a Resilience test. Even with the test, both the gamemaster and player should agree that the character should start on the path before the journey begins.

Each quality path includes a starting point—the prerequisites a character must have and the actions that must happen to start them on this path. The steps of the path are then laid out, and each step includes a note about how to move on from that step, including the requirements the PC must meet. In cases where judgment calls are needed, the gamemaster has the final say about whether a requirement has been met.

## THE BOUNDARIES OF HONOR

### STARTING POINT

To start on this path, a character must have the Honorbound quality, and they must violate the code enough (either in severity or frequency) that the character questions the code they had and the role it plays in their life.


---


# STEP 1: BROKEN CODE

The Honorbound quality has listed consequences for those who break the tenets of their code; this quality goes beyond those consequences. This replacement quality represents someone who no longer believes in the code that used to guide them. Maybe they view it as a luxury they can’t afford, or maybe the world has made them believe the code simply does not lead to good results; whatever the case, they do not feel like they need to adhere to the tenets anymore.

One of the tricks of abandoning a personal code is that, frequently, others knew that there was a code that helped define you. The fact that a character has given up on what was a central part of their identity tends to get a negative reaction from others, so the character cannot gain or spend Edge on social tests involving anyone who knew that they had once followed a code.

On top of that, individuals with Broken Code often feel there is something missing in their lives, something that used to provide meaning and guidance. This can make them act erratically in social situations—though sometimes that works out for their benefit. An individual with the Broken Code quality replaces a die from their pool with the wild die on all social tests unless they spend Edge on that test (through any Edge function).

## HOW TO MOVE ON

The biggest requirement here is time—the character needs to live with the Broken Code quality for a time so they can properly assess how they want to move on. The base duration of this quality is six months of in-game time, though certain decisions or actions may affect that duration. Different things that may affect this duration are described below.

**Positive Example:** The character may encounter someone with the Honorbound quality and be impressed at how the quality is working for them. This could be someone with the same code they once had or a different one. As with the incident that caused the character to leave their code, this either needs to be a very dramatic short-term incident or long-term, repeated exposure to this individual. When the gamemaster judges that the player character has seen enough of this person’s code to be impressed by it, roll the Charisma + Logic of the character with the Honorbound quality; each hit reduces the minimum duration of the Broken Code quality by a week. This test cannot stack with any other similar tests or impressions from other individuals to shorten the duration even more.

This could also work to push the character toward the No Code quality, if they are impressed by someone who lives by that philosophy.

**Personal Study:** The character may recognize that there is a void in their life and take it upon themselves to study different philosophies and find something that fits them. Have the character make a Logic + Intuition (6) test. Any net hits decrease the duration for Broken Code by a week; if there are fewer hits than the threshold, increase the duration for a number of weeks equal to the difference.

**Flash of Intuition:** If the gamemaster and player agree to do this, the character can roll an Intuition + Edge (6) test at the beginning of each day. If they succeed, the first time they encounter some sort of personal code during that day, they will be inspired to adopt it for themselves. They receive the Re-Bound quality listed below, using the new code.

**Defeatism:** This only works to shorten the journey to the No Code quality. The character may continue to see problems resulting from personal codes, and they many decide that there is no point in having one. If they see at least four examples of people experiencing physical harm due to adherence to a code, or one example of someone receiving ten or more boxes of Physical damage due to adherence to a code, have the character roll Logic + Intuition; hits reduce the duration of the Broken Code by one week per hit, but only if the player intends to end on the No Code quality.

# STEP 2: NO CODE OR PENITENT OR RE-BOUND

There are three possible end stages of this path. Once the duration of Broken Code has passed, the character may decide that living life by a code is not the way they want to do things, so they receive the No Code quality. Alternately, they may decide to follow a new code, giving them the Re-Bound quality. Their final option is to return to the code they had previously left behind, giving them the Penitent quality. All three are described below.

## NO CODE

In many ways, this is similar to how a lot of shadowrunners live their life—from moment to moment, without any over-arching philosophy guiding their actions. It could be compared to not having the Honorbound quality at all, but there’s one key difference. Some things are not easily left behind, and there can be a certain bitterness and awkwardness when dealing with those who still follow the code. If the character encounters anyone who follows the code they left behind, they cannot earn Edge in any social situations with those individuals (if they have Edge, though, they can spend it).

## RE-BOUND

Sometimes, life takes us in strange journeys, and we end up with a new set of beliefs than what we started with. The Re-Bound quality is identical to the Honorbound quality, except that no new Karma bonus comes with it. The character has gone

---


through the challenging process of changing their beliefs, and now they have new guidance to live by.

### Penitent

A character with the Penitent quality is one who left their code, wandered through life without it for a time, and then decided life was better with it, so they came back to it. The Honorbound quality they had before is essentially restored to them, with one important difference: the time penalties for violating the code are doubled. The Penitent character has extra incentive to stay true to their code. They also gain a Knowledge skill about a topic related to their code.

## Once Bitten

### Starting Point

Characters enter this path after a severe and sudden injury, meaning they entered Physical overflow damage after only one or two attack rolls. The resulting effect is that they are more cautious, as represented by the Immediate Aftermath step. This step comes with neither a Karma cost or bonus.

### Step 1: Immediate Aftermath

In this step, characters receive qualities reflecting the immediate aftermath of the attack. They should receive either the Phobia or the Bad Memories quality to show the impact.

#### How to Move On

Many characters will simply stay in this step for a few months and then move on to step 2 automatically, using that as a step of extra caution. If they do so, the Phobia and Bad Memories qualities stick with them.

Others might skip ahead to self-medicating or looking for help, in which case they can skip straight to step 3. If they self-medicate, they take the Addiction step, while looking for help takes them to Reconditioning. This latter step requires maintaining a DocWagon Gold or better contract for two months or more.

### Step 2: Double Sure

Characters with this quality exhibit extra caution when entering a potentially dangerous situation. They will not round a blind corner, enter a dark room, or any other such activity unless they are certain someone or something (like a drone or a spirit) has taken a look first. They will be certain to double-check all information they get from one contact with another contact, and they’ll look for two sources for any information they need. This can make them slow in execution, but it’s not without its benefits. The character gains a +2 dice pool bonus on any Surprise tests.

#### How to Move On

It’s possible that the character might not move on. They might decide that the cautious life is the good life—avoiding major injury convinces them that they’re following the right course. However, worrying about whether there is a major threat around every corner can take a toll on a person, and the character might come up with a few different ways of dealing with the strain. They will only need to develop a new approach if their current approach fails repeatedly (meaning at least three times). “Failing” could involve getting injured or ambushed in a spot they had cleared, having a mission become substantially more complicated due to their need to be cautious, or being paralyzed by contradictory information they receive from their multiple sources.

Some characters may attempt to self-medicate, leading to the Addiction quality. Others might look for more constructive approach, getting help and leading to the Reconditioning quality. This latter step requires maintaining a DocWagon Gold or better contract for two months or more.

### Step 3: Addiction or Reconditioning

These two qualities are described below.

#### Addiction

The use of substances to deal with stress has led to a negative outcome, and the character has become addicted to whatever they were using. They receive a level 1 Addiction (p. 74, SR6) to that substance, but they do not gain the Karma bonus from the quality.

#### Reconditioning

The character develops habits and responses to their anxieties and become better able to handle them in the moment. For the most part they are able to function without their need for advance warning and double-checks, though when stress levels rise the gamemaster can require a Composure (2) test to see if the character slips back into their old Double Sure ways for the duration of the encounter.

After half a year with Reconditioning, the character can drop the Phobia quality if they received it, but they should keep the Bad Memories quality if they have that.

## Eye for an Eye

### Starting Point

The Sixth World is a violent place, and a high proportion of its residents have regularly seen and


---


experienced violence. People adapt to this in any ways; one of them is to imitate the behavior they see. The first step in this path, Violence Prone, can be selected at character creation as part of the character’s background, or a character can gain it if they are experiencing a regular amount of violence.

# STEP 1: VIOLENCE PRONE

The character believes that the way to respond to a punch is with a punch, and they are always ready for a fight. On the negative, they cannot gain or spend Edge on social tests where they or their team attempts to talk their way out of a violent situation, and they must succeed on a Composure (2) test to avoid jumping into the fray whenever they see violence near them. On the positive side, they are tough to catch by surprise since they’re almost always ready for a fight, so they get a point of situational Edge when making a Surprise test.

## HOW TO MOVE ON

Change here often happens because when it becomes clear that a character’s current way of doing things is not sustainable—when the character sees that their tendency toward violence is not making their life easier or better, they may be pushed toward a change. The inciting incident should be serious, something more than just a fistfight. It could be a run that was supposed to be quiet that gets loud due to the character’s tendencies, or a fight that they didn’t need to have leaving the character badly wounded. It could also be some relationships being broken due to the character being too willing to throw a punch.

The gamemaster and player can decide together when the player is at a breaking point and needs to change. The player can decide if they take the Heedless or Coping quality, though their decision should be consistent with the character’s actions and inclinations.

# STEP 2: HEEDLESS *OR* COPING

In this step, the player chooses either the Heedless or Coping quality, as described below.

## HEEDLESS

By taking this quality, characters decide that their problems came from not being violent *enough*, and they should take no partial measures. They don’t wait for violence to start—they start the violence themselves. They throw the first punch, fire the first shot, cast the first spell.

With this quality, characters make a Composure (2) test in any opposed situation. If they fail, they move to attack whoever they perceive as the source of their problem. This does not mean they immediately resort to lethal measures—they may just slap or punch an opponent to get their attention or send a message. But since violence has a way of escalating a situation, they’ll often cause more problems than they solve.

Heedless characters are very difficult to catch by surprise, since they are always ready for a fight. Their threshold for Surprise tests is 1, and they get a point of situational Edge when making Surprise tests.

## COPING

By taking this quality, characters are recognizing that they react with violence too often, and they want to control those tendencies more. They may count to ten, or breathe deeply, or engage in any other technique that helps them relax and focus their mind on solutions beside violence. When they are not able to use their technique, they must make a Composure (2) test or resort to violence, as with the Violence Prone quality. They gain a point of situational Edge when they try to dissuade others from violence or defuse a tense situation (only one point of Edge per attempt, even if it involves a long discussion).

## HOW TO MOVE ON

There is no set point where a character moves beyond the qualities in this step. It’s quite possible they may keep either quality for the remainder of their shadowrunning career. Moving to the next step requires both a conscious decision and dedication. Characters need to learn from a martial arts specialist who is proficient in the philosophical underpinnings of their art. This means the person who teaches them needs to have an Instruction expertise and a martial arts specialization. Receiving training from them is neither quick nor inexpensive. The character needs to pay the instructor 200 nuyen per month for twelve months to reach the next stage.

# STEP 2: CONSCIENTIOUS FIGHTER

At this step, the character has found a way to encapsulate their violent tendencies into an over-arching philosophy. They have not renounced violence, but rather chosen to focus it in a way that advances their overall goals and desires, rather than competing or interfering with them. They have learned a martial art, so they may select one from the list starting on p. 97; they must pay the associated Karma cost. They are aware of the potential of violence around them, though not as always prepared for violence as they were in the earlier steps. They only gain a point of situational Edge when they succeed at a Surprise test.

# Learning How to Deal

## Starting Point
Similar to Eye for an Eye, Learning How to Deal is the result of regular exposure to stressful situations, so it may be something a character starts with or obtains fairly early in their life as a *Shadowrun* character. They start this path with the Selective Numbing quality.

## Step 1: Selective Numbing
One way to deal with repeated negative experiences is to numb yourself to them. Characters with this quality are capable of turning off their emotions, making it so that they do not feel anything so that they don’t have to experience anything negative. This can be great for dealing with fear and anger, but it presents difficulties when it comes to interacting in social situations. Since emotions do not turn on and off like a light switch, muting them for a situation where it can be advantageous can also mean having them stay off when they could be useful. For this quality, a period of emotional numbing, once initiated, lasts for six hours. Once it ends, a new state of numbness cannot be started for twelve hours.

While in this state, characters gain +2 dice for any Composure tests or tests to resist spells including Confusion, Chaos, and Control Thoughts, and critter powers including Confusion and Fear. They cannot gain or spend Edge on social tests.

### How to Move On
As with other paths, characters do not move on until they are ready to do so. Maybe they had enough misfortune with Selective Numbing that they realize it’s time for a change, maybe they simply want to live in a healthier way, or maybe they fell into enough resources that they can pay to have someone help them to a different state of being.

The character needs someone to help them make adjustments to how they deal with emotions. This means either paying for a DocWagon Gold or better contract for six consecutive months or getting instruction from someone with specializations (or expertise) in Instruction and Psychology (or a related area). This instruction must happen at least twice a month for six consecutive months, and they must pay the instructor at least 200 nuyen a month. Once they have met this requirement, they move on to the next step.

## Step 2: State of Zen
By reaching this step, the character has learned how to apply a level of calm to their emotions, selectively tamping them down when needed rather than just turning them off. They receive a +1 dice pool bonus when resisting spells including Confusion, Chaos, and Control Thoughts, and critter powers including Confusion and Fear.

## Example of Quality Paths

A run goes bad, and a troll shadowrunner named Stomper is captured by the Ancients, the (in)famous all-elven go-gang. The group’s enmity towards trolls leads them to “make an example” of poor Stomper by torturing him, cutting off his horns, and posting pictures on the Matrix before the rest of the team manages to rescue him. Needless to say, the whole ordeal is almost guaranteed to leave Stomper a little messed up in the head, and the gamemaster asks him to make a Resilience test. Stomper rolls 2D6 and gets a 4, then applies a –1 penalty for “intended to terrorize the target” (which the Ancients’ treatment definitely was) to get an end result of 3. That’s lower than his current (8 – Willpower) of 4, so Stomper and the gamemaster decide that Stomper is going to take the Once Bitten quality path. He picks up the Phobia (Ancients) quality to represent his lingering fear of the gang, and he and the gamemaster also decide to give him the Bad Memories (Ancients) quality, which might make future encounters with the go-gang a little dicey.

A few months go by, and Stomper’s been dealing with his Phobia and Bad Memories the whole time without really confronting them. In order to avoid any sort of repeat of the traumatic event, he receives the Double Sure quality, getting into the habit of checking and double checking any information and plans, in the hopes that such activities will protect him. The Phobia and Bad Memories qualities remain in place, as the unaddressed trauma is adding burdens to his life.

Stomper thinks it’s time to deal with these issues, and he has just hit a few decent scores, so he splurges on two months of DocWagon Gold to get him the care he needs. At the end of the two months, the Double Sure quality is transformed into Reconditioning, and after six more months, Stomper is able to drop the Phobia quality. The Bad Memories, however, stay with him.

# FIGHTING FORCES

## Corporate Security Forces

### Lone Star

When your founding myth is that you’re the reincarnation of the famous Texas Rangers, you have a hell of a large pair of boots to fill. Lone Star cops vary immensely based on where they sit on the totem pole, but you can guarantee every one of them will have an “I can handle anything” attitude. Every Lone Star cop gets a firm brainwashing in corporate camaraderie based on some seriously skewed shadow-like activity when the drek hits the fan. These cops whoop some serious hoop when you come after one of theirs, no matter the bottom line, mainly because there is no effect on the bottom line when the boys in blue and yellow take it upon themselves to beat you to within an inch of your life, blackmail you into working for them, or straight-up execute you and dump your body in the barrens.

### Street Veteran  
*(Professional Rating 3)*

Cowboys one and all, they just vary in how hard they need to show off. The greener the “tin star,” the more bravado they need to show. Don’t make the mistake of thinking this bravado is false, though. Most of these cowpokes are looking for a way up, and demonstrating “Ranger grit” is a sure way to move up the corporate ranks.

Like a beat cop, but with a little more experience under their gunbelt. Most have a little cyber—some for the edge, others for the rush, but most from the injuries.

You’ll run across the street veterans all over the sprawl and most often in those tough neighborhoods where runners like to doss down. They start out with questions and intimidation. When the fighting starts, they call in to report (no, not the fighting starts, they call in to report).


---


call for backup, just report) and then use cover and tactics to get an advantage.

Decked out in the classic blue and gold that the Star is famous for, the average street vet wears their uniform with pride. Their pride is not just being a cop, though; it’s being good enough to have lived their life and survived so they can keep walking the beat.

### SWAT DOORKICKER  
*(Professional Rating 4)*

Special Weapons and Tactics has a particular meaning in the Sixth World. These special operators are geared up for trouble and called in to situations where the drek is going to hit the fan and the suits upstairs want to minimize the splatter. While magic is a great edge, it’s not common enough to be the focus of SWAT’s fundamental tactics. Instead, SWAT is built around augmentation. Chrome and steel make the toughest SOBs in Lone Star even tougher, but what truly separates them from the tin star on the street is teamwork. This group can coordinate attacks to within milliseconds before they come rolling over like a freight train off the rails.

You’ll run into these guys when you end up on the wrong end of a hostage situation, inside a sting, when you’ve drawn too much heat and they track you down, or if a high-risk target is rolling into town. If a situation makes your hoophole pucker, you might see that SWAT Citymaster rolling in!

### MAGE CORPS  
*(Professional Rating 5)*

Whether being called for arcane backup, looked to for spirit support, or called on to reinforce some warding or do astral overwatch, the Mage Corps has a wide breadth of talent. They aren’t usually the top of their class for tossing fireballs, but there are a few combat mages in the corps. Most of the members are given a wide spread of training to make them useful across the board, rather than being a niche tool.

You’ll run into them anytime you use more mojo than sense, at locations with arcane objects that need policing, and out on patrol every once in awhile, though often without their bodies. They rarely arrive on any scene without some astral backup, usually in the form of an air spirit, though Z-zones frequently get fire and earth spirits as well since they don’t care about local damage.

# Shadowrider  
_(Professional Rating 7)_

The Star doesn’t post this stuff on the public hosts, but they have shadow forces ready to roll without bothering with the whole Mr. Johnson rigamarole (not to mention human rights rules). They get their dossiers and assignments through a secure host, and off they go. They focus on hunting runners who have turned into homicidal sociopaths along with handling high-profile cases that require alternate tactics and minimal exposure. Runners are occasionally hired to augment a team and sometimes recruited if they have the right mentality. Usually the ranks of these crews are filled with secforce guys who have fragged their regular record and need this kind of anonymity to operate while still drawing a paycheck.

You’ll encounter these guys when they hit you with the same tactics you use to hit the corps. They won’t knock and warn you they’re coming in. They won’t hand you an arrest warrant. What they will do is shoot you in the face and then take a sample for DNA analysis or snap a photo with their smartgun cam as they’re pulling the trigger. They could also be your opposition if you get hired to foil a case they are investigating.

There is no standard uniform for a shadowrider, but most favor the classic-cool look of a custom armor jacket, black jeans, and a tactical turtleneck. Work pants sometimes swap over to cargo pants for storage, but these guys are usually decked out in top tech gear when the real drek hits the fan. They all learn very quickly how to blend in, and whether it’s a janitor’s uniform or a corp suit, they have very little trouble looking natural in most environments.

# Knight Errant  
## Firewatch  
_(Professional Rating 5)_

Special problems require special problem solvers, and KE fills the ranks of their Firewatch teams with some of the best alternate thinkers around. Cross-trained with government special operations teams (at least governments friendly to Ares), they come at problems with a massive collection of tools in their toolbox. They get access to mil-spec hardware and software, and you won’t find a single one still operating at mundane speeds. Whether boosted with machine or magic, they all face the streets with speed on their side.

You’ll encounter Firewatch if you hit a high-security Ares facility or target. They spend enough time trying to mop up insect spirits that you may come across them if you end up scuffling with the bugs. They don’t trust anyone, though, so you’ll be targeted as if you’re an ally of the bugs even if you are lobbing grenades and rockets at them like there’s no tomorrow.

They’re intimidating to the extreme. And that’s without the mil-spec bugslayer gear.

# Street Veteran  
_(Professional Rating 4)_

These guys are different from your average patrolman in one very important way: They’ve seen the drek and have decided to stay in it. They wade in on a daily basis, rubbing elbows with the people and looking for trouble before it kicks off. Others their age have already moved up off the streets or over to other, more respected positions, but the street veteran keeps the streets clean and knows when and where to bend the rules.

You’ll encounter these guys all over the toughest sprawls. Sometimes they’ll be great sources of

information; other times they’ll be the ones gunning for you because you got a little too hot in a public space. They tend to look a lot like any other cop out on patrol, but the look in their eyes tells you everything you need to know.

The KE beat-walkers are still decked out for a little intimidation. The usual collared cop suit is the basic wardrobe, but anywhere with the right level of climate or risk, you’ll find their beat cops taking on the KE straight coat. This is a standard long coat with a little extra weight at the bottom to hang down most of the time. It’s eerie to see everyone else’s clothes blowing in the wind and then have a few of these long-coat-wearing ghosts with no flutter in their fabric. Knight Errant makes sure to highlight the black-and-red tones for their uniforms so folks know this is KE.

## Detective Mage  
*(Professional Rating 5)*

Flashy combat mages get all the headlines, but the bulk of Knight Errant’s magical resources actually go into their investigative division. Tracking down perps both arcane and mundane, they are most often a runner’s worst enemy within the security corp. Their ability to track people down with ritual samples means it’s best to bleach your blood. Or burn it. With the number of years’ worth of experience they have under their belt, they aren’t stupid and don’t risk their lives for no good reason. Expect a more defensive game from them if you cross their path. While it’s not universal, every group has their hoophats, the force is full of their friends and geeking one of these mages is going to get that classic cop response, and you won’t survive arrest or trial. You are also unlikely to get the classic “Do this job for your freedom” offer.

You’ll encounter them out in the world looking into arcane crimes as well as being used on more mundane work from time to time if the powers that be deem it worthy, meaning someone pays them to solve an issue. Some of them are also brought in as protection on high-profile targets, when more versatile talents are required.

These guys laugh at the concept of a uniform. They wear what they want and try to best fit whatever situation they are dealing with. Standard corporate policy requires a certain level of corporate casual, but they don’t always follow the rules on the street. In the office, sure, they’ll dress according to code, but out on the mean streets, they toss on what they need to feel safe or, more often, make whoever they are talking to feel safe.

To customize each one of these guys you meet, add a totem. Many follow Wise Warrior, but Coyote, Snake, and Thunderbird have their fair share of adherents.

## Other Security Providers

### Wolverine Security  
*(Professional Rating 3)*

The name is the best indicator for how this small security corporation operates. As a subsidiary of Ares, just like Knight Errant, they have access to the mega’s goodies but operate on a smaller and more focused scale. Though by “more focused,” I really mean “more ferocious.” Any place that has Wolverine as the sec force is going to have a ruthless SOP. They won’t pull punches, won’t show mercy, and might even add a little something extra just to be sadistic. To the brutes this corp hires, being cruel is the norm, and every one of them can usually back up their cruelty with force. If they can’t, they have no problem calling in some friends to help guarantee people remember and reinforce the Wolverine reputation.

You’ll run into these guys at remote Ares facilities along with other remote or rough locations working contracts for other corps and Ares subsidiaries. They rarely get to operate in civilized areas because of their penchant for violence before thought.

## HARD CORPS SECURITY  
*(Professional Rating 3)*

Think of Hard Corps as the bargain-basement security option in the Ares stable. They’re not rent-a-cop-level cheap, but they aren’t much better. Their major contracts consist of apartment buildings, basic work sites, low-security laboratories, and other places where the goal is to chase off opportunistic agents of chaos by the mere appearance of security personnel. Generally speaking, the stuff and personnel on site aren’t really worth enough for anyone to actively try to steal something. As a piece of the Ares security force pie, Hard Corps gets plenty of Knight Errant wannabes and cast-offs who have a chip on their shoulder but aren’t any tougher or better trained than the rest of the bunch.

You’ll encounter Hard Corps when checking out low-rent apartments, construction sites, non-vital lab and production facilities, and just about anywhere else someone wants a presence but doesn’t want to fork over a ton of nuyen.

# Minuteman Security  
*(Professional Rating 4)*

A lot changed for Minuteman in recent years, and the security corp has done quite a bit to rebrand itself. A rebranding made far easier thanks to being owned by the best spin firm on the planet. Horizon has shifted Minuteman to be the security at almost all of their facilities. They lease out the excess (which is considerable) to several other small corps and a number of their own subsidiaries, and they have bids in for several metropolitan contracts all over the UCAS, CAS, CFS, and PCC. There was a rumor during Seattle’s sprint for freedom that the contract would go to Minuteman, but the firm isn’t big enough to handle a metroplex of that size.

With a collection of interesting experiences under their belt and some creative cross-training, Minuteman has a preferred SOP. They observe first, ascertain threat and danger to local resources, and then contact or initiate an engagement plan. This usually means they will start out with a few Observe in Detail actions and then call in backup appropriate to the threat and the equipment said threat is carrying, often utilizing a swarm of deckers to brick everything in the Matrix before their security personnel ever fire a shot.

# Centurion  
*(Professional Rating 5)*

Calm, cool, and collected is the name of the game for this Saeder-Krupp subsidiary, even in the heat of deepest Africa. Centurion’s contracts are heavy in Africa and Europe, with smaller and more focused work in sprawls around the world. They offer supplemental units, including spec ops, counter-intel, and most famously, gang-task forces. Their tactics are cold and methodical when it comes to dealing with problems, all the way up to eradicating entire gangs as a solution.

Centurion forces can be identified by the red-and-gold highlights within their uniforms, along with the touches of the Roman legion. This includes the Xiphos tactical gladius issued to every officer. Centurion operates across several Spanish, Italian, and Balkan states in Europe, along with numerous African nations. They have smaller contracts in Seattle, California Free State, the PCC, and a growing representation in Denver, despite Centurion’s draconic ownership. They operate as supplemental forces to local security and police forces, even hiring runners to bolster their own numbers and fill in roles they are lacking in a region.

# Eagle Security  
*(Professional Rating 5)*

Since this firm originated in the NAN, one would have expected them to gobble up all the local contracts, but Eagle made its biggest global impact with its work in Chicago before its collapse into Bug City. The hit to their reputation would have been devastating, but instead it turned out to be the shake-up they needed. They hold major metro contracts in the UCAS, CAS, Sioux Nation, and Salish-Shidhe as well as local contracts in the same nations along with Tsimshian, AMC, CFS, and a handful in the Carib League. They take a stoic and ponderous approach to policing; they certainly have a skill and even aptitude for violence, but they tend to hold those tightly in check. Many of Eagle’s most talented and versatile officers were trained in the Sioux military. While they may not get a lot of ex-Wildcats, they get a fair number of those who washed out somewhere along the line but still had the discipline for public work. Within their ranks they also possess a higher-than-average number of metahumans and Awakened individu-

als. After the debacle in Chicago, they also have a special operations unit called the Pisko, who are trained bug hunters. Unlike some of their counterparts in other megacorps, they offer no quarter and have zero desire to research and learn from their prey. They exist simply to annihilate.

Their standard uniform is tactically focused and comes in brown or black, depending on the contract area, but both have small red-and-white highlights. Many of their dress uniforms display Lakota-inspired patterns with shell and bead accents.

## PETROVSKI SECURITY  
*(Professional Rating 4)*

Their name does a good job of hiding their affiliation with Mitsuhama, and they keep the layered protection rolling with names like Ertxantxa, Total Service, and ProTek in their subsidiaries. Every one of these companies operates under MCT’s zero-zone policy on protected sites, and since Petrovski and Parashield operate like devilish siblings, you could get targeted by both of them if you cross one of them. As a subsidiary of the number-one megacorp in the world, Petrovski is gaining contracts left and right, often to gain favor with their parent corp. They’re professional, cold, and have little moral compass to guide them when it comes to security operations. For Petrovski security officers, the job and the security of the site come above everything else. Rumors in the shadows even claim that threats to their families and loved ones don’t work.

No matter the subsidiary, there is a single unifying factor across all the corpsec uniforms: Mitsuhama blue and the MCT star within the background. The pale shade of blue is standard within the corpsec colors, and the star makes it into every logo. They’re done subtly, to blend into uniforms, but a keen eye can discern it. The uniforms for special operators tend to have a tactical focus, while clean lines dominate the clothing of those out front acting as a visual shield for the corp. The guards standing at the front gates get heavy armor and mirrored helmets for maximum intimidation. You can also take a look at their feet. Petrovski has made the Bates-Brown combat boot standard across all their forces.

## PARAMILITARY FORCES

Paramilitary forces are a different form of association than government or corporate military forces or street gangs. They differ from professional fighting forces in that they are most often culturally or politically motivated. The best of these are local militias that form for mutual protection in a hazardous world. The worst of these are racist extremists, such as the armed forces of the Humanis Policlub.

These are an example of a violent human supremacist paramilitary group. Their cells can be found near almost any major urban center in the world, tied together under a loose association. They follow a chain of command based on military ranks. The majority of their numbers are angry, noisy, and obvious bigots. These people are treated as expendable attack dogs, given little information beyond propaganda and even less attention to their safety. They are, however, heavily armed. Paramilitary soldiers gather for training exercises and constantly hone their skills for the moment they will be called upon to crack some skulls on behalf of human supremacy.

Humanis paramilitary groups are often well-funded by wealthy sponsors and crowdfunding campaigns, and some are directly supported by organized

crime. They also often enjoy preferential treatment by law enforcement. Even their lowliest grunts are well-armed and -augmented. They distrust magic and believe technology is the ultimate equalizer. Guns, ammo, armored-up vehicles, and cyberware are human innovations, so they invest in them with gusto.

# HUMANIS GRUNT

**(PROFESSIONAL RATING 2)**

These weekend warriors form the bulk of the numbers of the violent arm of Humanis. They’re impulsive, mean-spirited, and well-trained. When not out clashing with protesters or working their day jobs, these warriors spend their time at shooting ranges and drilling tactical maneuvers. They follow orders without question, whether those orders are to kill or use restraint. The first round of combat they will move to cover, take cover, and ready their weapon. Before each shot they will almost always spend one Minor Action to Take Aim. Their tactics are simple, direct, and brutal, and are usually directed by a Humanis Sergeant (see below) who is in turn receiving Matrix and command support. Whenever possible, group their attacks using the Grunt Groups rule. They will focus fire on any known magicians first, followed by the biggest or most well-armed metahumans on the field. If their leader is defeated or their squad suffers unexpected casualties, they are likely to break and run. Deep down these people are ultimately cowards—cybered-up and lethally armed bullies who only truly like to fight when the hurt they dish out won’t be reciprocated. When reality doesn’t match their expectations, they are likely to start shooting at anything that moves with as many bullets as they can fire. When in this mode, they will abandon Take Aim actions and choose their targets indiscriminately, targeting random bystanders and even each other.

# HUMANIS PARAMILITARY SERGEANT

**(PROFESSIONAL RATING 3)**

Weekend warriors who have proven themselves to be dedicated to the cause, effective in combat, and capable of keeping their cool under fire are provided with more expensive augmentations and positions as sergeants. They are also given the responsibility to lead and train a squad of soldiers, and they are responsible for keeping the violent tendencies of zealots in check. Managing public perception of events is more important to the cause than killing enemies.

Unless ambushed away from their buddies, the Humanis Sergeant will fight alongside a squad of Humanis Grunts. Their first actions in combat will be to move to cover, take cover, and ready their weapon. In subsequent rounds they will fire from cover, using the smartlink to negate the disadvantage. They will spend any additional available Minor Actions to Take Aim. They are unlikely to panic if a fight goes poorly; instead, they will attempt a measured retreat and escape. If the sergeant is killed, the grunts under their command are highly likely to panic. Whenever possible, combine the attacks of other grunts to assist the sergeant’s attacks using Grunt Group rules.

# HUMANIS CYBER SOLDIER

**(PROFESSIONAL RATING 4)**

This heavily augmented sociopath represents a significant amount of resources invested into zealots for the cause who care nothing for the larger implications of their actions. For some, the tenets of their cause are only a means to focus their violent tendencies. They may not be the best super-soldiers money can buy, but they’re brutal, effective,


---


and feel most alive when killing. They also follow orders without questions but have a tendency to go berserk. Augmentations, firepower, and indoctrination together give them a sense of detached invulnerability.

These grunts are often deployed along with other grunts, but separate from the pack almost immediately and head to the best firing position they can find. They will follow orders to attack specific targets but are generally expected to get in position and wait for further orders. If ordered to attack, they ruthlessly hunt their designated targets one at a time. When fighting alongside a larger Humanis group, they see themselves as the real threat—the others are just a useful distraction.

During combat, they use a Minor Action to Take Aim before each shot and focus their attacks on one target at a time whenever possible. Unless engaged at close range, they take advantage of cover and the smartlink’s ability to negate the disadvantage of firing from cover. When engaging at close range, they still prefer to use firearms whenever possible and will attempt to break off to fire from a position with cover. Once a cover position has been compromised (by too much fire coming their way, spirits materializing behind them, drones flanking, or some other similar drek), they will take a Major Action to sprint to a new cover position, use a Minor Action to take cover, and save the rest of their Minor Actions that round for Dodge Actions (+4 dice to Defense Pool at the cost of one Minor Action). To establish them as separate, lone-wolf types, do not combine their attacks as part of any Grunt Group attacks.

# Humanis Decker  
_(Professional Rating 4)_

The Humanis Paramilitary Decker acts as an intelligent and sometimes aggressive Matrix reconnaissance support. They tend to stay safely ensconced in a vehicle, office, or nearby café during any violent action. This decker is constantly searching and scanning for icons and data in order to find information that can be used against their enemies or to assist their allies. During an operation, they will be jacked into the Matrix via Cold Sim somewhere out of sight nearby. They will spend at least one Minor Action per round on a Matrix Perception test, using any remaining Minor Actions for the Send Message action to keep everyone on their team updated. Major Actions are spent either using Snoop to spy on targets, Control Device to sabotage devices, or Data Spike to target enemy hackers and drones. They particularly enjoy targeting personas that have the Biofeedback program loaded.

> Their activities involve driving the general around and using drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, but they’re equipped for heavy combat. The Toyota Gopher mounts a big machine gun that can be deployed with a Major Action. Unless there aren’t enough available targets, the rigger will almost always use multiple attacks to split their dice pool between two targets. If they must focus fire on a single target, they will use Burst Fire. Horizon Flying Eyes are their preferred drones due to their ability to have built-in thermal smoke grenades, which are often expended to screen an advance, protect a retreat, or create a distraction. In an emergency or special occasion, they can call upon an Ares Black Sky air-to-ground combat support drone, which will take several rounds to arrive on the scene and will then begin firing rockets from extreme range. Any Humanis soldiers will be given at least one round’s worth of notice to vacate the vicinity. If the rigger’s vehicle is not in harm’s way, they will jump in to the Ares Black Sky when necessary, but they usually leave the firing up to the drone’s targeting software.

# HUMANIS GENERAL

_(Professional Rating 5)_

The Humanis Paramilitary General is the person in charge of an entire local regiment of troops. Depending on the city, that might mean a dozen trusted warriors or several hundred. This character is the military equivalent of a face. They go out and talk to people to gather information and coordinate with highly positioned people in society who support their cause but don’t wish to be openly associated with violent human supremacists. When not planning operations designed to intimidate and demoralize metahumans, they’re usually working on gathering resources, acquiring funds, and solving problems for wealthy racists. Over the course of one day it is not unlikely for them to visit a Mafia don, a black-market weapons dealer, BTL smugglers, human supremacist conspiracy broadcasters, law-enforcement personnel, and senators. During combat, they will observe from a safe distance, often riding along with one of the regiment’s riggers. They will spend most of their Major Actions to Observe in Detail, and Minor Actions to Send Messages via their headware commlink. Their function is to observe, command, and designate attacks to the most dangerous targets. If faced with direct combat, they will try to break away from combat as quickly as possible, striking targets with brutal unarmed attacks or silenced pistol shots.

# RACER

(Elf, Professional Rating 3)

The masters of those hyperbikes can make them dance in the densest traffic. They’re as sleek and fast as their bikes, but all it takes is an off comment about being faster, better, or slicker than they are, and they’ll be looking to race. They’ve also been known to roll up on anything that might be fun to outrun (including cops and corpsec) and issue a challenge in the flashiest way possible. They often carry a rider into gang scuffles, and while the added weight might slow them a tick, the riders know how to operate from the back of a two-wheeled street rocket.

# GANGS

## ANCIENTS

The Ancients are one of the pre-eminent gangs in all the Sixth World, recognizable around the globe. The neon-green A, the pointed ears, and the distinctive flash of hyperbikes and blazing magic make the arrival and presence of the Ancients unmistakable. But not all Ancients are the same. They have magic, muscle, and skill, but not always wrapped up in the same individual.

It’s good to know they all have egos as big as their bikes are fast. Pompous condescension combined with whip-crack violence define the interactions with most Ancients. Their rep is important, but if you’re too insignificant to cause them to lose face, you’re generally safe. Generally.

Note that the three archetypes listed below have elf racial adjustments applied.

# GUNNER

(Professional Rating 3)

If you ever want to start an instant fight, make some kind of comment about the gunner “riding slitch.” They aren’t keen on the slight, and it kicks off a fight even faster than calling them a dandy-eater or a keeb. The gunners in the gang prefer SMGs or machine pistols, but some pull out the occasional assault rifle or shotgun. Most are also skilled with a sword just in case a more classic and personal message needs to be sent.

# MAGE

(Professional Rating 4)

Boosting or protecting the rider’s bike is usually a no-no, but anything else goes in terms of magic from the back of an Ancients motorcycle. Electricity and ice are top choices, but fire makes for great flair. A fancy levitation-assisted dismount makes quite the impression. As does the barrier spell dropped in front of a rival or on an angle for a little ramp. The magic minds in this gang don’t think anywhere near the box, and you’ll find arcane creativity flowing as fast as the blood is spilled.

## HALLOWEENERS

Fire safety is something you will never hear out of the mouth of a Halloweener or one of their offshoot gangs. Associated with flaming pumpkins and happy to make their iconic gang symbol a reality, they don’t just haunt Sleepy Hollow. Instead, they have found—and scorched—a place to call home in most of the major sprawls in NorthAm and several others around the world. It seems pyromania is popular in any nation. As their name would imply, they prefer black and orange for their gang tags, and most have some form of facial tattoos or regularly paint their faces. The madness that infects them usually varies by the level to which they have ascended in the gang.

### NEOPHYTE  
*(Professional Rating 2)*

The newest among the Halloweeners are usually the most dangerous, even though they’re not the most skilled. Attracted to flames and fires, they are desperate to make a name and filled with visions of burning the world to fit the gang’s image of the ideal future. Many of these youngsters don’t make it far, as fire is an unforgiving mistress, but those who do slide up to the next rung of the firebug ranks.

# Molotov

_(Professional Rating 3)_

Halloweeners who survive a few burnings realize that the gang may seem like a raging wildfire to those outside their ranks, but being inside lets you see the point of the fire and the flame: purification. This isn’t theological, but simply a desire to return everything to a simpler time when fire was respected. Halloweeners who reach these ranks see people’s everyday use of fire and flame and despise how their powerful mistress is taken advantage of and disrespected. Molotovs have the discipline and experience to harness fire safely and wield it with focus and precision. Halloweeners are certainly aware of the irony of this behavior when combined with the rank’s title.

# Master of the Flame

_(Professional Rating 4)_

Just below the leaders and masters of the gang are the masters of the flame. The descriptive phrase “a fire in their eyes” is usually literal with this lot. Whether cyber, bio, AR, arcane, or otherwise, virtually every Halloweener at this rank has glowing or burning eyes. Most claim it as the touch of the fire always within or some similar drek, but it at least offers some visual signal for the insanity inside their minds. They no longer indiscriminately burn things, but instead burn with the precision of a surgeon. They’re still bat-drek crazy and can rarely be convinced of anything that deviates from their views, but what else do you expect of a gang that practically worships fire?

# Cutters

While other gangs operate wildly, the Cutters have transformed into an almost businesslike street gang. A few have compared them to organized crime syndicates, but they lack the breadth and depth of those organizations. They look and act professionally when they can, and they prefer a touch of sophistication to looking like street trash, even going so far as to wear designer armor. Make no mistake—they’re still a street gang and thus still have to fight for every block of turf they control, but they do it without wanton violence, and preferring precision over overwhelming force.

----

# Corner Dealer

_(Professional Rating 2)_

Dressed in très chic fashion, the corner dealer is the lowest on the Cutter ladder. They act tough, try to prove themselves with slick “business” moves, and work hard to make every contact and connection they can in order to move up the organizational ladder. The problem is they often overstep the wrong folks, build up favors with the wrong people, and usually end up as the chum for the sharks they are swimming with.

# Negotiator

_(Professional Rating 3)_

Once you learn that you are not the end-all, be-all of gangland skill, you can stop acting the part and start working every angle. The negotiators aren’t high-ranking in the gang, but they are important enough to be protected. They usually have an entourage when headed to meetings (though what ganger wanders around alone?) that consists of a couple up-and-comers and a pair of thugs. They stay calm when the drek starts to fly, and they’re pretty good at reading a mark. They know the guy in the room who’s going to pull the trigger without hesitation, and they know the guy who ends up at the bar after every run gone south because they hate killing.

# Legbreaker

_(Professional Rating 3)_

Every gang needs thugs, and the Cutters are no exception. The thing about these guys is, they act like causing injury is a business transaction. They’ll only break the proper number of bones to match the current debt or the market value of the current transgression against the gang. They aren’t all brutes, either. Several of the Cutter’s most well-respected legbreakers are actually quite mousy but terrifying to watch in action.

# First Nations

With the strength of the NAN practically shattering a major world power, the rise of a primarily Amerind gang was no surprise to anyone. The direction they took left their tribal leaders appalled—but what gang ever bothers to try making people happy? Pulling cultural cues from across the tribes of North America, the First Nations style can end up looking a little haphazard. While some criticize them for their cross-cultural borrowing, they learn quickly that while the gang members may mix Hopi and Cherokee with a little Seminole and Iroquois, they learn the meaning behind every style they steal. So mock their garb and see if they don’t take a piece out of you in compensation.

----

# Warrior

_(Professional Rating 3)_

Traditional style meets modern tech with most members of the First Nations. The regular toughs on the street add native flair to almost everything they don, whether it carries a function or not, though often they do. Chem sniffers in the feathers, MADscanners in the bone armor, and high-end sensorware packed into that wild headdress are just a few of the surprises tucked behind those ancient accoutrements.

# Traditionalist  
*(Professional Rating 5)*

Everybody mocks these guys until they disappear in a blink, and a moment later you feel razor-sharp flint gently caressing your neck. These members take the traditions and history of the native people to heart. They avoid modern tools when possible (most still own a commlink) and train themselves to rely on skill, training, and smarts rather than modern advantages that can be stripped away by a skilled hacker. Within the gang, the traditionalists are usually honored members and rank among the leadership, though rarely in the top position, as others within the gang don’t trust their anachronistic nature.

# Shaman  
*(Professional Rating 4)*

Magic isn’t common anywhere, but the First Nations attracts disenfranchised NAN youth, many with the Talent, like moths to a flame. They see a cause, a chance to rebel, and a way to learn without sweating in a lodge or freezing their hoops off on a vision quest in the woods. They have a bit of a wild streak, and most see their gift as a reason to feel superior—some even think they deserved to be worshipped. The gang has, on occasion, had issues with their shamans turning toxic from the lack of discipline and the abuse of their power.

# Smokers Club

Assassins. Need I say more? This “club” of killers for hire varies across the ranks, and honestly each one is truly individual in their style, preferred methods, and contract requirements. They work all over the world, and sometimes runners work for them—or against them. Being on either side can be dangerous, because these lone wolves have no qualms sacrificing the pack in order to get to their objective.

----

# Young Buck  
*(Professional Rating 3)*

While the club itself doesn’t formally allow membership to anyone who isn’t already a skilled professional, there is a pool of young talent, people who have the necessary skills to get the job done but are waiting for that big break that gets them noticed by the powers that be. These young guns may not be the most skilled, but they make up for their lack of skill with a level of ingenuity only seen in those who are crazy or a genius. Their tenacity also tends to help a lot.

# Social Adept Assassin

_(Professional Rating 4)_

The best in the business pass you by and leave you unaware. They blend when they need to, portray who they need to, and ignore anyone who does not serve their purpose of reaching their intended target. If that target is you, they could be the delivery gal, the old lady on the street, the squatter begging for a soyburger, or the up-and-coming exec you don’t see coming. They fill the role they need to, and moments later could be someone else entirely.

Air ducts, access hallways, elevator shafts, and warehouse rafters are just a few of the places that these individuals will traverse to get the angle they need to be your angel of death.

Their magic makes it easier, but their skills and cunning are just as critical for these invisible assassins to strike hard and then fade into the shadows.

# Long Gun

_(Professional Rating 5)_

The classic sniper, perched on a rooftop so far off they don’t need a suppressor because their target and those who hear the shot are linked only by existing in the same sprawl. They still might use a suppressor anyway, because modern surveillance and ballistics tech can go a long way to track the trajectory of a bullet. The skill to take this kind of shot is rare, and once all the clues come together, the list of potential ghosts behind the gun is short. Luckily, most of them are masters of keeping their face off camera, and they exist only as monikers placed on them by law enforcement who link them by skill and style rather than face and fingerprint.

# SHADOWRUN

## LIGHTS OUT!

Shadowrunners are not the only people who know the benefits of working in the dark. All sorts of dirty deeds are about to take place where they cannot be seen. Several cities across the UCAS will go dark, losing power with no clear way to get it back. The ensuing chaos will reshape the nation and the whole world—and provide lots of shadow work for those who can handle it.

*Cutting Black* is a plot book with the background and fallout of this blackout, and *30 Nights* is a campaign book taking runners through a full month in blacked-out Toronto. Together, these books plunge players into a new kind of action, as the Sixth World tears itself down and struggles to see what will emerge from the wreckage.

Both books are available at game stores and **catalystgamelabs.com**!

[The image shows two book covers from the Shadowrun series, with a background illustration of a man casting a fire spell from his hands. The top book cover is titled "SHADOWRUN 30 NIGHTS" with a purple logo above the title and a subtitle "CAMPAIGN BOOK" at the bottom right. The cover art depicts a person in goggles surrounded by ghostly figures. The bottom book cover is titled "SHADOWRUN CUTTING BLACK" with the subtitle "PLOT SOURCEBOOK" at the bottom right. The cover art shows a heavily armed figure in futuristic armor in a cityscape with spider-like creatures. Both books have the "CATALYST" logo at the bottom left. Below the books, there is a neon-style logo with the text "XXX EST. 1989" and the "CATALYST game labs" logo beneath it.]

[The image shows a stylized digital artwork of a futuristic combat scene. The background depicts a cityscape with tall buildings illuminated in yellow and purple hues. In the foreground, a heavily armored soldier with cybernetic enhancements is firing a large gun. The soldier is facing left, with visible mechanical details on the armor and head. To the left of the soldier, a figure with short hair and a jacket is also firing a handgun. Above the scene, the word "FIN" is prominently displayed in bold yellow letters against a dark blue background. The overall color scheme is dominated by shades of purple and yellow, creating a high-contrast, neon-like effect. There are no additional text elements, tables, or other content on the page.]

# PAIN POINTS

**SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, IS ABOUT TO GET HURT.**  
Guns will come out. Swords will unsheathe. Damage will be done. The same questions are at the center of it all: Who will suffer, and who will survive?

Shadowrunners stare violence in the face daily, deciding how much they’ll inflict, figuring out how they’ll remain alive. They know the prices that must be paid—the hard work of training, the challenge of recovery, and the continual effort to live with what you’ve done. Some shadowrunners develop a code to help them know what to do and what to avoid. Others decide to just develop a short memory.

*Firing Squad* is the book to help shadowrunners pay those costs. It has new weapons, qualities, and techniques to hone shadowrunners’ combat abilities while also looking at how to develop characters based on the codes they follow and the violence they face. Take your character through new twists and turns and experience the shadows in a brand-new way.

*Firing Squad* is a core combat rulebook for *Shadowrun, Sixth World*.
