# Roadmap

## MVP (playable)
- Campaign start (auto-name, SR6e, PC, #GMPCs)
- Mission hub (jobs by contacts, expiring by runs; news; clocks; roster)
- Runs (chat-only)
- Debrief + background world evolution (SSE updates)
- Character Builder 100 CP via Overseer chat; strict finalize validation
- Data import (PDF → reference tables)
- User Preferences (content guardrails; thoughtful prompts toggle)

## Post-MVP
- Overseer persona (global) & duet with GM
- Priority build system; richer builder UI
- Calendar-time system (switch job expiry to days)
- Deeper GMPC management & policy (spotlight tokens/cooldowns)
- Private intel archive (datachips), loadouts
- Multi-user roles & real-time chat
