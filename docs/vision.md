# Vision

- **Roleplay-first**: chat is the primary UI.
- **Fail forward**: failure generates consequences, not game over.
- **Structured world**: jobs, contacts, factions, clocks, economy.
- **Lean loop**: Hub → Run → Debrief → Evolve → Hub.
- **Pragmatic AI**: small model for GM chat; ~13B planner as a background pass.
